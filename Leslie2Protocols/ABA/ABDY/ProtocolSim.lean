# The protocol under its composed reading

The protocol reading of `ABA/ABDY/Protocol.lean` and the composed reading of
`ABA/ABDY/Hybrid.lean` present one protocol at two cuts. A process record of the
protocol carries the round-loop record beside the stage record of every round
the process has touched (D22). A composed state carries one graded-agreement
instance per round, at every moment. The stage record of round `r` at a
process is the entry of that process in the instance of round `r`, so the two
cuts hold the same stage data indexed two ways: by process on one side, by
round on the other.

Everything here is read in the namespace `ABDY`, where each name is that of its
counterpart in the gather-based chain's `AFW`, and the qualifier is dropped below.

## The relation

`ProtocolRel` pins every coordinate of a composed state, in five conjuncts and
under no guard.

* The round loops are the first components of the process records.
* The coin oracle is the same component on both sides.
* The ABA-side network is the protocol adversary's DECIDED pools beside its
  corrupted set.
* The fabric of round `r` is the adversary's round-`r` message pools beside the
  same corrupted set. Corruption is one broadcast on both sides, so every copy
  of the corrupted set is the adversary's.
* The entry of process `j` in the instance of round `r` is the stage record of
  round `r` that `j` holds. This is one equation for each pair `(j, r)`. A
  round `j` has not touched reads as the initial stage record on the protocol
  side, and the equation asks the composed entry to be initial there too.

A composed state is therefore determined by any protocol state related to it.
The determination is not injective: no composed state carries a termination
flag, so two protocol states differing only in which processes have terminated
are related to the same composed state.

## What this file supplies

`protocolSim`, a probabilistic forward simulation of `composed P` by
`protocol P` along the Dirac lift of `ProtocolRel P`, and the trace-distribution
inclusion `protocol_composed` it yields. The inclusion is one-directional
because the composed reading takes transitions the protocol declines. A round
instance has a row for the Byzantine graded-agreement drives, and no protocol
program has one (D11, D22); the instance's stage rules carry no termination
guard, so the instance answers a send or a delivery at a process the protocol
has terminated. In the other direction the protocol's `terminate` row writes a
field the relation does not read, and the composed answer to it is a stutter.

/-- **The relation of the protocol presentation to the composed one.** Writing
`u = (procs, w, o)` and `t = (G, C, A, o')`, the five conjuncts are: the round
loops agree; the oracle is shared; the ABA-side network is the adversary's
DECIDED pools beside its corrupted set; each round's fabric is that round's
slice of the adversary's pools beside the same corrupted set; and the entry of
process `j` in the instance of round `r` is the stage record of round `r` that
`j` holds (D22). No conjunct is guarded, so the composed state is determined. -/

/-! ### Couplings

Every protocol transition is a product of Dirac factors beside the oracle's
successor distribution, and so is the composed transition that answers it. The
coupling is functional in the oracle coordinate: the two presentations carry the
same oracle, so a protocol outcome and the composed outcome that matches it
differ in no coordinate the relation constrains. -/

Two shapes of answer. A label the composed system takes on the nose is

/-! ### The drive rows the protocol process group cannot take

A Byzantine graded-agreement call or return names a process, and the protocol
program of that process has no row for it (D11, D22). Neither has the replaced
program of a corrupted process, those labels lying in `actsAt` (D23). The
process group is a full synchronisation, so no protocol transition carries
either label. -/


/-! ### The matching, by label class

A transition of the protocol group is a hidden rendezvous, a visible shared
label, or the silent label. Each is answered by a transition of the composed
group on the same label, built from the rows of the four composed components.
A corrupted process's replaced program is matched loop for loop: where the
protocol program self-loops, the composed round loop takes `corruptedIdle`.
The return that self-loop carries without DECIDED evidence is authorised on the
composed side by the ABA-side network's Byzantine row (D23). -/
