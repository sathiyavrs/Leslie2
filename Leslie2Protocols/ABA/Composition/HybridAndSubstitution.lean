# The specification stages: the composed reading and the substitution

Two links of the refinement chain, and the row-by-row readings of the systems
they introduce. The headlines that chain these links with the earlier ones are
in `ABA/Results.lean`.

The first link is the composed reading. The protocol reading of
`ABA/ImplementationByABDY/System.lean` presents the protocol as `n` programs beside one network
adversary and the coin oracle. A program reads its own replacement flag and
nothing else about corruption: not the corrupted set, not the budget, not
another process's status (D23). Each program runs its round
loop and a graded-agreement stage at once, and the single adversary holds both
kinds of message sent. The composed reading reads the same protocol as a
composition of components:

* the graded-agreement side is the round-indexed family `GBCA.ByABDY.gbcaSide`. Its
  round-`r` instance is a parallel component in its own right: the stage
  programs of round `r` beside the network of round `r`, which that
  instance owns outright;
* the round loops are `n` separate automata (`coreProcN`), synchronised;
* what is left of the network adversary is the DECIDED sets beside the
  corrupted set (`aNet`);
* the coin oracle enters through the same label pullback as in the protocol
  reading (`Composition.wccLift`).

The four components speak the extended alphabet `Composition.NLab n`, the rendezvous
labels are hidden, and the result is read back over `Lab n`. The round loops,
the ABA-side network and the lifted oracle are defined in `ABA/Composition/Components.lean`,
the round instances in `ABA/Composition/GBCAInstanceByABDY.lean`; the composition pipeline
`ABDY.composedPre` / `ABDY.composedGroup` / `ABDY.composed` is the first section below.

The second link is the substitution, which replaces each round's
graded-agreement instance by that round's specification. `hybrid` is the
system that results, read at the protocol shape. The substitution is one
application of `ProbabilisticForwardSimulation.parallel_right` under a
syntactically identical context, followed by the three congruences the protocol
pipeline is built from: `abstract` for the rendezvous alphabet, `relabel` for
the read-back to `Lab n` (`Framework/Relabel.lean`), and `abstract` again for
the sub-protocol API. The conclusion is `ABDY.substitution`, the inclusion of the
composed system's achievable trace distributions in the specification's.

## Per-round memory

A round instance is a component of the composite from the start, not an object
created by the round's first call, and it keeps its stage records and its
network state for the whole run. The graded-agreement coordinate of a composed state
is therefore `ℕ → GBCA.ByABDY.ImplState n`: every round is present at every moment,
whichever round each process is in. Those retained stage records are
specification-side state in one respect only: a process record of the protocol
holds its own stage records in a finite map and, once it terminates, answers
nothing further, where the round instance answers at every moment (D22).

## The authorisation relocation (D11)

A round instance carries no `k ∈ F` guard on the handshake-row labels `byzCallG`,
`byzCallGLoop` and `byzRetG` (`Composition/GBCAInstanceByABDY.lean`, D11). A handshake-row label
stays visible at the instance boundary and is authorised outside it. Here `aNet` is
that outside, and it carries the guard on its own copy of the corrupted set.
The two copies are written by one broadcast: `fail` reaches every round's
network through the family (`gbcaSide_fail`) and `aNet` on its own `fail` row,
and `GBCA.ByABDY.GNetState.corrupt` and `ANetState.corrupt` are the same
budget-guarded insertion.

## What this file supplies

The composed system and its rows, the protocol-shaped specification and its
rows, and the substitution between them. The builders assemble a transition of
a composite out of transitions of its components (`composedPre_vis_step`,
`composedPre_tau_gbca`, `composedPre_tau_aNet`,
`gbcaSide_owned`, `gbcaSide_idle`, `gbcaSide_tau`, `gbcaSide_fail`,
`composedGroup_of_event`, `composedGroup_of_tau`, and their counterparts on the
specification side). On the specification side the reading also runs in the
inverse direction, from a composite transition back into the rows its
components contributed, and a labelled transition takes one of three routes through the
two hiding frames. The per-component rows these consume and produce are the tables
of `ABA/Composition/Components.lean` and `ABA/Composition/GBCAInstanceByABDY.lean`.

The core simulation of `ABA/HybridRefinesSpecification/Simulation.lean` runs from `hybrid` on this
vocabulary, and the non-vacuity witnesses of `ABA/HybridRefinesSpecification/NonVacuity.lean` are
built with it; `ABA/Results.lean` chains the simulation with the substitution and,
through `safety_transfer`, reads off the protocol's Validity and
Agreement guarantee.

The composition hides `NetEvt n`, so a transition of `ABDY.composedPre` on a
rendezvous label is a silent transition of `ABDY.composedGroup`, as is one on `τ`.
The two stage rendezvous never reach this point. They are internal to a round
instance, hidden inside `GBCA.ByABDY.sub`, and reach the composite as the family's
own `τ`. -/

/-! ## The protocol-shaped specification side

The composed system replaces its graded-agreement component `GBCA.ByABDY.gbcaSide` —
the family of round instances — by `specSide`, the family of round
specifications read over the protocol alphabet. The other three components are
reused verbatim,
so the substitution is `ProbabilisticForwardSimulation.parallel_right` applied
under the syntactically identical context, followed by the three remaining
congruences: `abstract` for the rendezvous alphabet, `relabel` for the read-back
to `Lab n`, and `abstract` again for the sub-protocol API. -/

/-- **The specification side of the protocol**: the ℕ-indexed family
of round specifications, read over the protocol extended alphabet along
`GBCA.ByABDY.gPull`. A round-tagged label — including a Byzantine handshake row of that
round — moves its round alone, `τ` moves one round, and `fail` is the
broadcast that keeps every round's copy of the corrupted set in lockstep. -/
