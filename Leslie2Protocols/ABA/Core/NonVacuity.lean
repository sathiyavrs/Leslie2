# Non-vacuity witnesses for the protocol-shaped specification

Machine-checked evidence that the composed system `hybrid P` can actually
execute a nontrivial prefix: the core simulation `ABA.coreSim` about it is not
vacuously true through an immediate deadlock.

We fix the small parameter set `P4` (`n = 4`, `f = 1`, `ε = 1/2`) and exhibit a
concrete **20-step run of `hybrid P4` that reaches a genuine `retABA`** — a
complete decision — starting from its initial state:

* `step_callABA₀/₁/₂` — three external input handshakes (`callABA`, *visible*:
  the addressed round loop takes its `input` row, the other three idle, and the
  round specifications, the ABA-side network and the coin oracle idle);
* `step_callG₀/₁/₂` — three graded-agreement calls (`callG 0`, *hidden* to `τ`:
  the caller's round loop hands over its estimate and the round-`0`
  specification takes its owned `call`);
* `step_bindUnset` — the round-`0` specification's `bindUnset` internal
  transition excluding the bit `false` (a family `τ`, `n − f` quorum met at
  `n = 4, f = 1` by the three callers of `true`);
* `step_retG₀/₁/₂` — the three graded-agreement `A`-return handshakes
  (`retG 0`, *hidden*), the first locking the round grade to the `A`-side. Each
  return announces the bound bit `true`. Its complement is the bit that
  `step_bindUnset` excluded, which is exactly the return's guard, so the ghost
  output leaves the run intact;
* `step_callW₀` — process `0`'s coin call (`callW 0`, *hidden*), a recording
  call: a single caller does not carry the count past `f = 1`;
* `step_callW₁` + `step_callW₁_mass` — process `1`'s coin call, the resolving
  call and the run's **single probabilistic step**: that access carries the
  caller count to `2 > f` at `val = ⊥`, so the call records its caller and
  draws `val` from `wccPMF`. The successor lands on the `bit true` branch — the
  outcome agreeing with the bound value — with mass exactly `ε = 1/2 > 0`;
* `step_callW₂` — process `2`'s coin call, recording again: `val` is resolved,
  so the resolving row's guard is closed;
* `step_retW₀/₁/₂` — the three coin returns, each a rendezvous on `retWPub`
  (*hidden*): the round loop's fused round advance (deviation D10) joined with
  the network's publication of `⟨DECIDED, true⟩`, giving three distinct
  DECIDED-true senders;
* `step_deliver₀/₁/₂` — the adversary delivers all three receipts to process `0`
  (a rendezvous on `ddlv`, *hidden*), meeting the `n − f = 3` return quorum;
* `step_retABA` — process `0` fires `retABA 0 true`: the decision.

Plus `step_fail` — a `fail` broadcast synchronising all four components.

Because every step but the resolving call is a Dirac and the chosen branch of
that call has mass `ε > 0`, the whole path is a positive-probability execution: a
product of Diracs times one `ε` factor. Every guard on these closed numeric
states discharges by `decide`/`rfl`; the Dirac successor distributions collapse
through `prodPMF_pure_pure` and `PMF.pure_map`, and the resolving call's branch
mass through `prodPMF_pure_left_apply` and `map_apply_inj`.

The ABA-side components are named through the view of `ABA/ABDY/ABAState.lean`: a
state of the run is a triple — the round specifications, one `ABAState` holding
the round loops beside the ABA-side network, and the coin oracle — assembled
into the four-component state by `st`.
