# The GBCA implementation instance (ABDY22 Algorithm 6)

The round-`r` instance of the Graded Binding Crusader Agreement protocol, as an
LTS over the shared alphabet `ABA.Lab n`.

*Attribution.* The file transcribes ABDY22's Algorithm 6 — the 6-round Graded
Binding Crusader Agreement for Byzantine faults — directly. The level mapping is

```
INPUT = echo,  ECHO = echo2,  VOTE = echo3,  BIND = echo4,  ECHO5 = echo5
```

and the three returns are the decide conditions of lines 23–29.

Each process runs the message pattern

* `INPUT b` — multicast on being called; relayed after `f + 1` receipts;
* `ECHO b` — multicast once `INPUT b` was received from `n − f` senders
  (which also puts `b` into the derived set `Valid`);
* `VOTE v` (`v ∈ {0,1,⊥}`) — a real bit after an `n − f` `ECHO b` quorum, `⊥`
  after `n − f` `ECHO`s of any payload with `|Valid| > 1`;
* `BIND v` — the same pattern one level up, over `VOTE`s;
* `ECHO5 v` — the same pattern one level up again, over `BIND`s;
* return — grade `A b` after an `n − f` `ECHO5 b` quorum, `B b` after an
  `n − f` any-`ECHO5` quorum containing `b` with `f + 1` `BIND b`s and
  `|Valid| > 1`, and `C` after an `n − f` `ECHO5 ⊥` quorum with `|Valid| > 1`.

Every transition is Dirac; asynchrony and Byzantine behaviour are modelled
by nondeterministic `τ`-transitions.

## Why the cited algorithm and not the blueprint's `alg:GBCA` (D18)

* **D18 (the five message levels).** This is a deviation from the source
  blueprint's `alg:GBCA`, which presents a **4-round compression** of
  Algorithm 6: the `echo5` round is elided, the decide conditions read one level
  down, and the grade-1 evidence is `f + 1` `VOTE v` where Algorithm 6 has
  `t + 1` `echo4 v`. The compression violates the paper's Graded Binding. One
  process held at the echo stage through a grade-0 decision can afterwards
  direct its write-once echo at either bit, and one corruption completes
  `f + 1` `VOTE v` for the bit of the adversary's choice — so two extensions of
  a single `C`-return hand out two different bits. The encoding therefore
  follows the cited algorithm rather than the blueprint's compression; the
  upstream blueprint carries a matching red annotation.

The grade-1 evidence is what the depth buys. `f + 1` `BIND v` receipts exceed
the corruption budget, so they guarantee an honest `BIND v` sender, whose own
wait-condition is an `n − f` `VOTE v` receipt quorum over the write-once `VOTE`
level — and that quorum is the object the paper's binding argument counts
(Lemmas 4.8/4.9 through E.9).

*Transcription note.* The prose preceding Algorithm 6 says "upon receiving
`echo4` messages from `2t + 1` parties" where the pseudocode's lines 19–20 say
`n − t`; the two coincide only at `n = 3t + 1`. The encoding follows the
pseudocode (`n − f`).

## Model and deviations (continuing the project's D1–D4)

* **D1 (determinised `fail`).** As in the spec instance, corruption is the
  total Dirac function `ImplState.corrupt` — `F` stays in lockstep with every
  other component under the `fail` broadcast.
* **D5 (set-based network).** Multicasts are idempotent: each sender owns a
  *set* `sent j` of messages it has multicast, and `recv i j` is the set of
  messages from `j` that the adversary has delivered to `i` (`deliver` is a
  `τ`-transition requiring `m ∈ sent j`). Thresholds count *distinct senders*
  in the receiver's delivered sets, so message duplication and point-to-point
  scheduling are absorbed into the set model. A corrupted sender may inject
  any message into its `sent` set (`byz`).
* **D8 (participation guard).** Protocol sends (`relay`, `echo`, `vote*`,
  `bind*`, `echo5*`) and the three returns require the process to have received
  its input (`input ≠ none`): the algorithm's handlers only run inside a called
  instance. The send rows are taken in the wait-until order of Algorithm 6
  from the `BIND` level down: each of those rules requires the process's own
  send at the level below. The `VOTE` rules ask for no own send, the `ECHO`
  they read being sent by an `upon` handler that may still be pending. The
  return rules carry the negations that the algorithm's if/else chain implies.

The state is exactly the protocol's own data, held in two halves: each process
keeps its own local state beside the messages delivered to it, and the round's
network state keeps the per-sender sent sets and the corrupted set. `ImplState` is
their pair, so the network is a component of the state and not a field of it — a
weaker network is a different second component and leaves the rest of the round
alone. The three return transitions are cases (1), (2), (3) of Algorithm 6's
lines 23–29: case (1) an `n − f` `ECHO5 v` quorum, case (2) an `n − f`
any-`ECHO5` quorum containing `ECHO5 v` together with `f + 1` `BIND v`s and
`|Valid| > 1`, case (3) an `n − f` `ECHO5 ⊥` quorum with `|Valid| > 1`. Beside
the receipts of its own case, each return reads the receipts named by the
cases above it in the chain, the process's own `ECHO5` field, and the call
record. The binding and grade information that the specification tracks is an
abstraction of these receipt patterns and lives only on the specification
side; the refinement (`GBCA/ABDY/RefinesSpecification.lean`) supplies it from the receipts.

## The round's bound bit

The specification announces a bound bit on every return label (`ABA/GBCA/Specification.lean`).
The implementation announces one too, and holds it in the write-once field
`GBCA.ByABDY.GNetState.bound` of the round's network state. The field is a ghost: it is
auxiliary state, no program reads it, and the three return rows are the only
rows that touch it.

`boundOf` computes the bit from the round's sent sets, the corrupted set and the
outcome. A return of outcome `out` announces `bound.getD (boundOf sent F out)` —
the bit already on record if the round has returned before, and `boundOf`'s
otherwise — and writes it back, so the round announces one bit on all of its
returns. The three return rows are otherwise the rows of Algorithm 6 unchanged:
the announced bit enters no guard of the algorithm and no field a program holds.

/-- **The round's bound bit**, as a function of the round's messages. It is the
bit a return of outcome `out` announces on its label.

A value-bearing outcome announces the value it hands out. An outcome carrying no
value announces the payload of an honest `⟨VOTE, b⟩` sender, and `true` where
there is none. An honest `⟨VOTE, b⟩` sender holds an `n − f` `⟨ECHO, b⟩`
receipt quorum and at most one bit carries such a quorum, so on a reachable
state the two bit branches are exclusive and the order in which they are read
is immaterial. Where neither branch applies no bit is ever handed out, and the
announced bit is the surviving one of a round that hands out nothing.

The bit is a ghost output: no program reads it, and the three return rows are
the only rows that read it. -/

/-! ### The two halves of a round's state

The data of one round sits in two records. Each process holds its own protocol
state together with the messages delivered to it, and nothing else — there is
no record there of what it has multicast. The round's network state holds the
per-sender sent sets and the corrupted set. The instance's state below is their
pair, so every field of the algorithm is a field of one local state or the other.

The network state carries the name of the instance that composes it beside the
programs (`ABA/Composition/GBCAInstanceByABDY.lean`). -/
