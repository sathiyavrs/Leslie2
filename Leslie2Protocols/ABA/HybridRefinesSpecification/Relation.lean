# The core-simulation relation

The relation and invariant for `coreSim : hybrid ⊑ ABA.spec`. The abstract
abstract state never fires `SpecStep.coinFlip`: it answers every hidden row, the
concrete coin included, by stuttering under a constant coupling, and its mode
is `ControlMode.flipEnabled` throughout. It decides once, in the `SpecStep.decide` τ-step
that leads the first `retABA` row.

* `Abs` — the abstract-state constraints (C1 `F_eq`, C2 `ret_eq`, `mode_flipEnabled`,
  `input_sync`, and C3/C7 `phase`).
* `Inv` — the concrete invariant (forty fields, docstring-numbered
  I0–I30, a few numbers covering a small group of fields: the replacement
  flag against the corrupted set, F-lockstep, input
  coherence, the `RoundSettled`-keyed round skeleton with quiescence, DECIDED
  coherence, A-grade commitment, delivery soundness, round/phase coherence,
  support sent sets, and the burn-proof certificate conjuncts I28–I30).
* `coreR` — the simulation relation `Inv ∧ Abs`, wrapped in `diracRel` by
  `HybridRefinesSpecification/Simulation.lean`.

This file holds the two predicates, their frame and reader lemmas, and the
initial states. The proof that `coreR` is a simulation relation runs in the two
files above it: step inversion for `hybrid` and preservation of `Inv` in
`HybridRefinesSpecification/InvariantPreservation.lean`, `Abs` preservation for the stutter rows and
the assembly in `HybridRefinesSpecification/AbstractStatePreservation.lean`.

/-! ### Abs: the abstract-state constraints -/

/-- Constraints tying the abstract state `a` to the concrete state. The abstract state
never fires `SpecStep.coinFlip`: its mode is `ControlMode.flipEnabled` throughout, so
`SpecStep.decide` stays enabled at every state it reaches. It lives in one of
two phases keyed on `a.val`. In **phase 1**, before the first visible return,
nothing is decided and every hidden row is answered by a stutter. In **phase
2**, entered by the `SpecStep.decide` step that answers the first `retABA`
row, `a.val = some v` and `v` is certified by a concrete `A`-lock.

The ghost record `a.input` agrees with the committed concrete input at every
honest process, in both phases. A `callABA` at a process holding no input
commits the bit on both sides, and at a process holding one the concrete loop
and `SpecStep.callLoop` both write nothing. At a corrupted process the clause
is vacuous, and the counts that read the record carry such a process through
their `id ∈ F` disjunct. -/

  decided. Phase 2 (post-return): `val = some v` with `v` certified by a full
  `A`-certificate, and every honest `A`-decision holder — live grade or sent
  DECIDED — names `v` (the F-free universal that survives corruption of the
  original witnesses). -/

some process exited `GBCA_r` via a `B`/`C`-return": round `r`'s surviving bit `v` has
provenance either from round `0`'s external input (`input_g0`-style, if `r = 0`) or from round
`r - 1`'s surviving bit/`C`-lock (`call_prov`-style, if `r ≥ 1`) being the opposite bit — both

equality, the `r ≥ 1` branch only the exclusion-set/grade ones). -/

  has reached (or passed) the "done with `GBCA_r`" point, round `r` is either already graded or
  a `DissentWitness` certifies why not. Established at the `retG` row (the genuine GBCA return

  the counts are permanent. Established at the `retC` row; preserved everywhere by
