# The main theorems of the ABA case study

The subject is the protocol `ABDY.protocol P`: `n` programs, one per process, beside
two components that are not processes — the network adversary, which owns the
message sets, the DECIDED sets and the corrupted set with its budget, and the
common-coin oracle, the only component whose transitions are not Dirac. A
program reads its own records, its own recv and its own replacement flag, and
nothing else about corruption: not the corrupted set, not the budget, not
another process's status. A corruption replaces the program of the process it
names (D23); whether another process may be taken off-protocol is decided by
the network's `k ∈ F` guard. A program holds its
round loop beside its stage-side record — the stage record of every round it
has touched, in a finite map — and terminates at `2f + 1` DECIDED receipts
(D22).

The abstract side is `ABA.spec P`, the single-automaton reading of agreement,
whose traces satisfy Validity and Agreement (`spec_safe`, `Spec/ABASafety.lean`).

## The chain

Three probabilistic forward simulations carry the protocol to the
specification:

1. `ABDY.protocolSim` (`ABDY/ProtocolSim.lean`) — the protocol into the composed
   reading, along the Dirac lift of `ABDY.ProtocolRel`. The relation pins every
   composed coordinate against the protocol state; the inclusion is
   one-directional because a round instance also answers the Byzantine handshake rows
   (D11) and the processes the protocol has terminated (D22).
2. `ABDY.substSim` (`ABDY/Hybrid.lean`) — replace each round's graded-agreement
   instance by its specification, the other three components untouched: the
   family substitution carried by four congruences (`parallel_right`,
   `abstract`, `relabel`, `abstract`).
3. `coreSim` (`Core/Sim.lean`) — the hand-built simulation of the
   protocol-shaped specification against the ABA specification, read in the
   composed coordinates: the round specifications, the `n` round loops, the
   ABA-side network and the coin oracle, each still a component of the state the
   relation is defined on.

`ABDY.refines` chains the soundness inclusions of the three (Result 1) by
`Set.Subset.trans`; `ABDY.chainSim` composes the three simulations themselves by
`ProbabilisticForwardSimulation.trans` (Result 2). The two routes are
independent — the inclusion never invokes transitivity of simulation.

## Scope of the headline

Graded agreement is carried to implementation level: each round is a group of
stage programs beside that round's own message state, moved by the same
network adversary. The **common coin is held at specification level** — the
ε-coin is `Params.wccPMF`, not a Gather/SRSD implementation — so the honest
reading is *graded agreement verified to implementation level; the coin
assumed at specification level*.

`ValidityTrace` (`Spec/ABASafety.lean`) is the paper-form predicate: a decided bit
must carry a provenance clause witnessed by a *never-corrupted*
(`NeverCorrupted`) supporter, matching the papers' correct-process Validity.
What is proven is safety — Validity and Agreement for every
positive-probability trace. Termination, liveness, unpredictability and
fairness are not claimed.

The `#guard_msgs`/`#print axioms` blocks below are the mechanical check:
the headlines, and the framework results the chain rests on, are pinned to the
clean axiom list `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

/-! ### The chain, link by link

Carry the protocol reading into the composed reading (`ABDY.protocol_composed`),
substitute each round's graded-agreement instance by its specification at the
protocol shape (`ABDY.substitution`), then take the core simulation (`coreSim`).
Every step is a simulation between systems the protocol reading itself
names. -/

/-- **The protocol-shaped specification refines the ABA specification**: the
soundness of the core simulation. -/
theorem hybrid_spec (P : Params) :
    achievableTraceDists (hybrid P) ⊆ achievableTraceDists (spec P) :=
  (coreSim P).achievableTraceDists_subset

namespace ABDY

/-- **Safety of the protocol reading**: every positive-probability trace of
every achievable trace distribution of the `n` programs beside the network
adversary and the coin oracle satisfies Validity and Agreement. The corruption
budget is a guard of the network adversary's own `fail` row, so every protocol
execution is in budget by construction and nothing is assumed of the
traces. -/
theorem protocol_safe (P : Params) :
    ∀ D ∈ achievableTraceDists (protocol P), ∀ t, D t ≠ 0 →
      ValidityTrace P t ∧ AgreementTrace P t :=
  safety_transfer
    (Set.Subset.trans (protocol_composed P)
      (Set.Subset.trans (substitution P) (hybrid_spec P)))
    (spec_safe P)

/-- **Trace conservativity of the protocol reading**: every
positive-probability trace of the protocol has positive probability
under an achievable trace distribution of the protocol-shaped
specification. -/
theorem protocol_traces (P : Params) :
    ∀ D ∈ achievableTraceDists (protocol P), ∀ t, D t ≠ 0 →
      ∃ D' ∈ achievableTraceDists (hybrid P), D' t ≠ 0 :=
  fun D hD _ ht => ⟨D, Set.Subset.trans (protocol_composed P) (substitution P) hD, ht⟩

/-- **Safety of the composed reading**: the substitution and the core
simulation carry the composed reading to the specification, so it inherits the
same guarantee. -/
theorem composed_safe (P : Params) :
    ∀ D ∈ achievableTraceDists (composed P), ∀ t, D t ≠ 0 →
      ValidityTrace P t ∧ AgreementTrace P t :=
  safety_transfer (Set.Subset.trans (substitution P) (hybrid_spec P)) (spec_safe P)

/-! ### The two routes -/

/-- **Trace-distribution refinement** (blueprint `thm:aba-main`, safety
fragment): every trace distribution achievable by the protocol is
achievable by the ABA specification. The composition and the substitution give
the first inclusion, the core simulation the second. -/
theorem refines (P : Params) :
    achievableTraceDists (protocol P) ⊆ achievableTraceDists (spec P) :=
  Set.Subset.trans (protocol_composed P)
    (Set.Subset.trans (substitution P) (hybrid_spec P))

/-- **Correctness of ABA** (blueprint `thm:aba-main`, safety fragment):
every positive-probability trace of the protocol satisfies Validity
and Agreement. No side condition on the traces: the corruption budget is a
guard of the network adversary's own `fail` row, so every protocol execution
is in budget by construction. -/
theorem main (P : Params) :
    ∀ D ∈ achievableTraceDists (protocol P), ∀ t, D t ≠ 0 →
      ValidityTrace P t ∧ AgreementTrace P t :=
  safety_transfer (refines P) (spec_safe P)

/-- **The composed simulation** `protocol ⊑ ABA.spec`: the three simulations of
the chain joined by Result 2 (`ProbabilisticForwardSimulation.trans`), along
the composite of their three relations — the Dirac lift of the composition
relation, the pointwise round substitution, and the core relation. -/
noncomputable def chainSim (P : Params) :
    ProbabilisticForwardSimulation (protocol P) (spec P)
      (compRel (diracRel (ProtocolRel P))
        (compRel (parallelRel (diracRel (RsubAll P))) (coreRel P))) :=
  (protocolSim P).trans ((substSim P).trans (coreSim P))
