# The ABA specification (blueprint Transition System 1)

This module is the account of record for what the ABA development specifies.

The state is the record `SpecState`: a ghost record `input` of genuine
`callABA` events (D13), the flags `ret` of the processes that have returned,
the corrupted set `F`, the decision value `val`, and a control mode
`mode ∈ {idle, locked, dead}` (D21). Eight rules act on it.
`SpecStep.callSet` and `SpecStep.callLoop` carry the honest interface call,
`SpecStep.coinFlip` is the mode loop, `SpecStep.decide` writes the decision
value, `SpecStep.ret` carries the honest interface return, `SpecStep.fail` is
corruption (D1), and `SpecStep.callByz` and `SpecStep.retByz` are the
corrupted interface. Every transition is Dirac except `SpecStep.coinFlip`.

The interface is the full adversary's. A corrupted process's call records a
bit unrelated to the one its label declares, and a corrupted process returns
any value at any time without moving the state. The honest rules stay
available to a corrupted process, so the two corrupted rules add behaviour and
remove none. The trace predicates of `Spec/ABASafety.lean` therefore quantify over
never-corrupted returners: a corrupted return carries an arbitrary bit, which
no property of the system can constrain.

The mode loop is the specification's liveness reading. From `Mode.idle` a
flip locks with probability `ε`, kills with probability `δ`, and releases back
to `Mode.idle` with the remaining mass. At `Mode.locked` the decision is the
only `τ`-rule the mode can enable, so a lock is never discarded; `Mode.dead`
enables no `τ`-rule at all (D17). The flip names no coin bit. Reading `lock` as the coin
agreeing with a round's reference value is an outcome coupling of a
refinement, not a component of this system.

The flip is gated on both bits carrying `f + 1` support, and the sum of the
two support counts never decreases (an overwrite moves a supporter from one
count to the other, a first write or a corruption adds to one), so a state
passing that gate leaves some bit supported ever after and the decision stays
enabled at `Mode.locked`; the Lean lemma is deferred.

Provenance rests on the ghost record and the support guard `SuppOK` (D13).
`SpecStep.decide` is the sole writer of `val`. Its guards are `val = ⊥`,
`SuppOK b` and `mode ≠ dead`, and the support guard is the entire constraint
on the value decided. The rule is therefore enabled whenever some bit carries
`f + 1` recorded-or-corrupt supporters and the mode is not `Mode.dead`; no
count of participating processes is read anywhere in the system.
`SpecStep.callSet` overwrites the ghost record while nothing is decided, so
the record holds the bit of the last such call (D16); `SpecStep.callLoop` is
the input-enabledness loop and records first-write-wins.

inductive SpecStep (P : Params) :
    SpecState P.n → Lab P.n → PMF (SpecState P.n) → Prop
  /-- Rule 1: an environment call records its bit in the ghost record. The
  write is an overwrite (D13, D16): while nothing is decided the record is
  revisable, so it holds the bit of the last such call. -/
  | callSet (s : SpecState P.n) (id : Fin P.n) (b : Bool) (hv : s.val = none) :
      SpecStep P s (.callABA id b)
        (PMF.pure { s with input := Function.update s.input id (some b) })
  /-- Rule 2: the input-enabledness loop for `callABA`. The label is enabled in
  every state; the ghost record takes the bit first-write-wins (D13). -/
  | callLoop (s : SpecState P.n) (id : Fin P.n) (b : Bool) :
      SpecStep P s (.callABA id b)
        (PMF.pure { s with input := if s.input id = none
                             then Function.update s.input id (some b)
                             else s.input })
  /-- Rule 3 (the flip): the only non-Dirac rule of the system. From
  `Mode.idle`, with nothing decided, one flip resolves by `flipPMF` into
  `Mode.locked` with probability `ε`, back into `Mode.idle` with probability
  `1 − ε − δ`, and into `Mode.dead` with probability `δ` (D17). It is
  one-shot: the three outcomes are the three modes, and the rule names no coin
  bit.

  The guard `hmix` is the mixedness gate: the flip fires only from a state
  where both bits carry `f + 1` support. Under honest unanimity on one bit the
  other bit is never supported, so the guard fails at every state such a run
  reaches. The flip is then unreachable, and with it every probabilistic
  branch of the system, so the unanimous path is Dirac. This is the liveness
  half of Validity, held structurally by the guard rather than proven. -/
  | coinFlip (s : SpecState P.n) (hm : s.mode = .idle) (hv : s.val = none)
      (hmix : ∀ b, SuppOK P s b) :
      SpecStep P s .tau
        ((flipPMF P).map (fun o => match o with
          | .lock => { s with mode := .locked }
          | .release => s
          | .kill => { s with mode := .dead }))
  /-- Rule 4 (decide): the sole writer of `val`. Its guards are `val = ⊥`
  (`hv`), `SuppOK b` (`hs`) and `mode ≠ dead` (`hm`), and the support guard is
  the entire constraint on the decided value: the bit `b` carries `f + 1`
  recorded-or-corrupt supporters (D13). A killed flip disables the rule (D17);
  at `Mode.locked` it is the only enabled `τ`-rule, and it is enabled there
  whenever some bit carries `f + 1` support. The mode returns to `Mode.idle`. -/
  | decide (s : SpecState P.n) (b : Bool) (hv : s.val = none) (hs : SuppOK P s b)
      (hm : s.mode ≠ .dead) :
      SpecStep P s .tau
        (PMF.pure { s with val := some b, mode := .idle })
  /-- Rule 5 (return): a process returns the decision value. -/
  | ret (s : SpecState P.n) (id : Fin P.n) (b : Bool)
      (h₁ : s.val = some b) (h₂ : s.ret id = false) :
      SpecStep P s (.retABA id b)
        (PMF.pure { s with ret := Function.update s.ret id true })
  /-- Rule 6 (corruption, deviation D1): a guarded deterministic transform.
  The guards `hnew` and `hbud` are the Failure rule's own: `id` is not already
  corrupted, and the budget has room. They are exactly the condition tested by
  the `if` inside `SpecState.corrupt`, so the effect is unchanged and only the
  enabledness moves into the rule. -/
  | fail (s : SpecState P.n) (id : Fin P.n) (hnew : id ∉ s.F)
      (hbud : s.F.card < P.f) :
      SpecStep P s (.fail id) (PMF.pure (s.corrupt P id))
  /-- Rule 7 (corrupted call): the recorded bit is independent of the label's.
  A corrupted caller's declared input need not be what is recorded, so the rule
  writes an arbitrary `b'` under the sole guard `id ∈ s.F` (D23). -/
  | callByz (s : SpecState P.n) (id : Fin P.n) (b b' : Bool) (hF : id ∈ s.F) :
      SpecStep P s (.callABA id b)
        (PMF.pure { s with input := Function.update s.input id (some b') })
  /-- Rule 8 (corrupted return): a corrupted process returns anything at any
  time. The state does not move, and the honest return rule `SpecStep.ret`
  remains available to it (D23). -/
  | retByz (s : SpecState P.n) (id : Fin P.n) (b : Bool) (hF : id ∈ s.F) :
      SpecStep P s (.retABA id b) (PMF.pure s)

/-- **Counterexample check (D13).** The Validity-violating trace dies at
`SpecStep.decide (b := true)`: with the inputs `1,0,0,0` recorded at
`n = 4, f = 1` and the sole `1`-inputter corrupted, the supporters of `1` are
that one process alone, so the guard `hs`, demanding `f + 1 = 2` of them,
fails. -/

    let input : Fin 4 → Option Bool := fun i => if i = 0 then some true else some false
    let F : Finset (Fin 4) := {0}
