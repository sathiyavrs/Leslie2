# Safety of the ABA specification

Validity and Agreement, stated as predicates on traces and proven for every
trace in the support of every achievable trace distribution of `ABA.spec`
(`ABA.spec_safe`).

Both predicates are read at never-corrupted returners. `SpecStep.retByz` lets
a corrupted process return an arbitrary bit at an arbitrary time, so nothing
constrains such a return and the unconditional forms are false. Corruption is
the trace-level notion `NeverCorrupted`, non-membership in every stage of the
corruption fold `failSet`. `AgreementTrace` requires two returns by
never-corrupted processes to carry the same bit. `ValidityTrace` is the
paper-form statement (D13): a return of `b` by a never-corrupted process is
*preceded* (positionally) by a `callABA _ b` event whose caller is itself
never corrupted. The witness axis is faithful to the papers: the witnessing
caller must be never corrupted, not merely a member of some support set that a
later `fail` could taint.

The proof is invariant reasoning along genuine executions (via
`TraceSupport`), on two invariants:

* `SpecInv` — the state invariant, in two clauses: the corrupted set respects
  the budget (`F_le`), and the decision value carries `f + 1` F-blind
  supporters (`val_supp`). The second clause is `SpecStep.decide`'s own guard
  at the one rule that writes `val`. Every rule that only grows the ghost
  record carries it by `SuppOK.mono`; `SpecStep.callByz`, whose write may
  replace a recorded bit, carries it by `SuppOK.callByz` instead, the writer
  being counted through the `F` disjunct.
* `ValInv` — the label-history-aware invariant: a ghost-recorded input is
  attributed either to a `callABA` event in the history or to the corruption
  of its own slot (`input_src`), and the corrupted set is exactly the fold of
  D1-`corrupt` over the labels seen so far (`F_eq`). The honest `callABA`
  rules record the bit their own label carries, which is what restores the
  first disjunct under the D16 overwrite; `SpecStep.callByz` takes the second.

Both branches run off one locator, `exists_retSite`: a `retABA` at trace
position `m` sits at an execution position whose pre-state carries `ValInv`
over the label prefix, has corrupted set the fold at `m`, and whose prefix
`callABA` events reappear below `m` in the trace.

Agreement rests on `SpecInv.val_stable`: `SpecStep.decide` is the sole writer
of `val` and fires only from `val = ⊥`, so the decision value never changes
once written. A never-corrupted returner is outside the fold at `m`, hence
outside the pre-state's corrupted set, so `retABA_inv`'s second disjunct is
impossible and both returns read that one value.

Validity is a budget pigeonhole at the return. `retABA_inv` reads the returned
bit off the pre-state's decision value and `SpecInv.val_supp` yields `f + 1`
supporters of that bit. Every supporter is either ghost-recorded or
ever-corrupted, and at most `f` ids are ever corrupted (`failSet` never
exceeds the budget), so some recorded supporter is never corrupted
(`exists_neverCorrupted_supporter`). Such a supporter lies in no prefix fold,
so `ValInv.input_src` yields its `callABA` event.

The same pigeonhole in the state alone is `SuppOK.honest_supporter`: a
supported bit has an uncorrupted recorded inputter. It is what makes the
mixedness gate on `SpecStep.coinFlip` unsatisfiable under honest unanimity,
which is where the specification holds the liveness half of Validity.

disjunct whatever its slot holds; every other slot is untouched. -/

/-- **The return locator.** A trace of positive probability is the external
filter of a genuine execution, and every `retABA` event at trace position `m`
sits at some execution position `j`. The pre-state `s` of that event carries
the history invariant over the label prefix, its corrupted set is the
trace-level fold at `m`, and every `callABA` of that prefix reappears at a
trace position below `m`. Both safety predicates are read off this one
