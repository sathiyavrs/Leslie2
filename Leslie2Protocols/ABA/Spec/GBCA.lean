# The GBCA specification instance (blueprint Transition System 2)

The round-`r` instance of the Graded Binding Crusader Agreement specification.

Binding is *negative* information. The state field `excluded : Finset Bool` is the
set of bits the instance can no longer hand out; it starts empty. The internal
τ-transition `bindUnset b` excludes one bit — `excluded := insert b excluded` — once a
quorum has spoken and `f + 1` F-blind supporters back the *surviving* bit `!b`.
No rule removes a bit and `bindUnset` requires `excluded = ∅`, so `excluded` is written
at most once per instance — the exclusion commits the round — and is monotone along
every execution; `corrupt` leaves it alone. The once-only guard is what makes
every fair round completable: a second exclusion after an `A`-return would strand
the processes yet to return, the value-bearing returns needing a live bit and
`retC` being blocked by the `A` grade guard. Every property below is a consequence of
that monotonicity plus the membership guards on the return rules, with no
auxiliary invariant.

Grades: `A b` (decide `b`), `B b` (adopt `b`), `C` (no output; adopt the coin).
The `grade` field (`some true` ≈ grade `1`/A-side, `some false` ≈ grade
`0`/C-side) enforces the A/C exclusivity of Graded Agreement: once an
`A`-return happened no `C`-return can, and vice versa.

## Graded agreement is the guard pair

Both value-bearing returns carry the guard pair `v ∉ excluded ∧ (!v) ∈ excluded`: the
bit handed out is alive, and the other bit is already excluded. That pair *is*
graded agreement, with no supporting argument. A return of `v` pins `!v` into
`excluded`; monotonicity carries `!v ∈ excluded` to every later state of the run; a
later return of `w` needs `w ∉ excluded`, so `w ≠ !v`, so `w = v`. Two returns in
one execution therefore name the same bit whatever their grades, and a single
bit — the unique survivor once any value-bearing return has fired — is the only
bit any extension can ever hand out.

## `retC` and Graded Binding

The `C`-return's guard `1 ≤ excluded.card` is ABDY22's Graded Binding clause read
on this state: *there is a bit `b` such that no non-faulty party decides `1 − b`
at grade `≥ 1` in any extension*. A member of `excluded` is exactly such a `1 − b`
— the witness `b` is its complement, the surviving bit — because the
value-bearing returns refuse an excluded bit, and `excluded` only grows, so the witness
is valid in every extension of the run and not merely at the moment of the
return. A `C`-return thus commits the instance: from that point on at most
one bit is alive anywhere in the future, which is what makes handing out no bit
the right answer. `retC` additionally requires `f + 1` F-blind support for each
bit (D15), which is what certifies that neither bit was forced.

## The all-⊥ run

In a round where neither bit is decidable the specification still commits
internally to a single excluded bit, and the run ends with `C`-returns alone.
That commitment is sound because the `C`-return's label carries no bit: the
instance never announces which bit it excluded, so no process is answered with
the internal choice. `retC`'s guard `1 ≤ excluded.card` is the binding witness
either way — a bit that no extension can hand out — whether the round goes on
to hand out its complement or hands out nothing at all.

## Provenance (D14/D15)

* **D14 (repair, load-bearing).** The source blueprint's TS 2 certifies binding
  by a *single* honest witness (`∃ id ∉ F, call id = b`), and `B`/`C` dissent
  likewise by a single honest dissenter. That singular witness is the same
  provenance loss the D13 repair removes from Transition System 1, one level
  down: the witness may
  be corrupted later in the trace, after which nothing attributes the outcome to
  a never-corrupted input — and `hybrid` built on this TS 2 provably violates
  the papers' Validity (deterministic witness at `n = 4, f = 1`, inputs
  `1,0,0,0`: bind at `1` off the sole `1`-holder, `retB`-adopt everywhere,
  round-1 unanimity decides `1`, `fail 0`, `retABA 1 1` — never-corrupted
  processes all input `0`). ABDY22's implementation carries the `f + 1` via
  Valid-set relay thresholds; TS 2 abstracted it to one witness.
* **D15 (the repair).** Every certificate is a count
  `f + 1 ≤ #{id | call id = some b ∨ id ∈ F}` at the relevant bit — exactly
  TS 1's `SuppOK` shape (D13), directly `F`-blind: the count is monotone in `F`
  and in `call`, so it is immune to later `fail`s. On the exclusion set the
  counts sit at three places. `bindUnset b` counts support for the bit it
  *spares*, `!b`; the `retB` dissent guard counts support for the bit it does
  *not* hand out, `!v`; `retC` counts support for both bits. Provenance survives
  verbatim: `F` is monotone with `|F_final| ≤ f`, so among `f + 1` distinct
  supporters some member is outside the *final* `F`, hence outside the current
  `F`, hence a never-corrupted genuine caller — corrupt supporters are paid for
  by the `F` budget itself, with no phantom-call bookkeeping. Chaining the two:
  a bit `v` handed out at grade `≥ 1` requires `(!v) ∈ excluded`, and the
  `bindUnset (!v)` that put it there certified `f + 1` F-blind supporters of
  `!(!v) = v`; the budget pigeonhole then recovers a never-corrupted genuine
  caller of `v` behind every value-bearing return.

* **D19 (the state shape).** The source blueprint's TS 2 carries a bound value
  `bind ∈ {0, 1, ⊥}`. The exclusion set is the excluded-bit reading of that
  value: `excluded ∈ {∅, {b}}`, embedding `bind = ⊥ ↦ excluded = ∅` and
  `bind = b ↦ excluded = {!b}`. The two states therefore differ in the guards, not
  in the cardinality. The blueprint's `bind = some v` guard on the
  value-bearing returns becomes the pair `v ∉ excluded ∧ (!v) ∈ excluded`, its
  `bind = none` guard on binding becomes `excluded = ∅`, and the `C`-return's
  binding obligation `bind ≠ ⊥` — which in the source also puts the bound
  value on the label — becomes `1 ≤ excluded.card`, read off a label that names no
  bit.

Every transition is Dirac, so the instance is an LTS and the `ForwardLTS`
correspondence applies. `fail` is the determinised D1 `corrupt`; the family
(`GBCA.specFamily`) broadcasts it to all rounds.

`SpecState.corrupt` writes `F` and nothing else, so every other projection
passes through it untouched. These four `@[simp]` lemmas are the canonical

read them from here rather than reproving them locally. -/
