# Safety of the GBCA specification instance

Binding is the promise a Graded Binding Crusader Agreement instance makes about
its *future*: there is a bit the instance will never hand out, in this run or in
any extension of it. On the specification state that promise is a field rather
than a theorem. `SpecState.dead : Finset Bool` is the set of bits the instance
can no longer hand out; the value-bearing returns refuse a dead bit and demand
that the other bit be dead, and the `C`-return demands that some bit be dead.

Binding and graded agreement rest on one fact: `dead` only grows. The single
writer is the internal `bindUnset`, which inserts, and `corrupt` does not touch
the field — so `Step.dead_mono` holds rule by rule, and `is_exec_stable` lifts
it to whole executions (`dead_mem_stable`). Binding is
therefore structural: a bit killed at any point of a run is killed at every
later point, and a guard reading `∉ dead` can never be re-enabled. That writer
also fires only from `dead = ∅`, so the exclusion set never holds more than one
bit (`dead_card_le_one`, from the step-level `Step.dead_card_le_one`): the kill
commits the round, and the surviving bit stays available to every later return.

* `retG_value_agree` — **graded agreement**. Two returns of one execution that
  hand out a bit hand out the same bit. A return of `v₁` fires from a state with
  `(!v₁) ∈ dead`; monotonicity carries that membership to the state of any other
  return; that return needs its own bit alive, so its bit is not `!v₁`, so on
  `Bool` it is `v₁`. No invariant, no quorum arithmetic, no reachability
  hypothesis beyond membership in one execution.
* `specInst_binding` — the same statement read off the trace: any two round-`r`
  graded-return labels of a positive-probability trace of `specInst P r` that
  name a bit (`outValue`, defined here: `A b` and `B b` name `b`, `C` names
  nothing) name the same bit.
* `retC_dead_nonempty` — the **Graded Binding witness**, as the complement of
  the bit the return kills. After a `C`-return,
  `dead` is nonempty in every later state of the execution. A member of `dead`
  is a bit no non-faulty party can be handed at grade `≥ 1` in any extension,
  which is ABDY22's Graded Binding clause; the witness is produced at the
  `C`-return and survives because `dead` never shrinks.
* `specInst_validity` — **Validity, safety half**. If every round-`r` call of
  the trace carries the bit `v` unless its caller is corrupted somewhere along
  the trace (`UnanimousInput`), then every round-`r` return of the trace hands
  out `v` (`ValidityTrace`); in particular no `C`-return occurs
  (`specInst_no_retC`). The other two halves of the papers' Validity clause —
  that the grade is the top one, and that every non-faulty process is answered
  at all — are fairness statements about which runs the scheduler must extend,
  outside the scope of a safety file.

"Corrupted somewhere along the trace" is `SpecSafety`'s never-corrupted
formulation, taken verbatim: `NeverCorrupted P t id` is non-membership in
`failSet P t k` for every `k`, the trace-level fold of D1-`corrupt` over the
`fail` labels, so a `fail id` that the budget refuses does not count as
corruption. Validity is the D15 counts read against that budget. The state
carries no invariant beyond a bookkeeping one (`CallInv`: every pending input
is attributed to a `callG` event of the history, and `F` is the fold of the
history's `fail` labels); the argument is then a pigeonhole. At any state,
every id supporting the dissenting bit `!v` is corrupted at some stage of the
trace — a caller of `!v` by unanimity, an `F`-member by the fold — and
`failSet` is monotone in the stage, so the whole support set sits inside one
`failSet P t K`, of size at most `f` (`supp_le_of_unanimous`). The D15 guards
asking `f + 1` there are therefore unreachable: `bindUnset v` never fires, so
`v` is alive at every state (`dead_notMem_of_unanimous`), which forces the
value-bearing returns to hand out `v` and refutes `retC` outright.

The scope is the specification instance alone. That the implementation refines
it — hence inherits these properties — is the subject of the per-instance
forward simulation.
