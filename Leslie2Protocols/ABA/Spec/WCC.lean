# The WCC specification instance (blueprint Transition System 3)

The round-`r` instance of the Weak Common Coin specification. The coin
resolution is the only probabilistic transition of the whole development
besides `ABA.Spec`'s: once more than `f` processes (counting corrupted ones)
have called, `val` resolves by `wccPMF` — each bit with probability `ε` (all
correct processes receive that bit), the failure outcome with probability `δ`,
and `⊤` with the remaining mass (the adversary controls per-process return
values).

The coin's value domain `ABA.TVal` is declared here, together with the map
`ABA.CoinOutcome.toTVal` that sends a `wccPMF` outcome to the value the
resolution writes.

Deviations: the `guess` label is omitted (D4 — it exists solely for the
out-of-scope Unpredictability property), and `fail` is the determinised
`corrupt` (D1).

* **D17 (δ-mass failure outcome).** The coin implementation the source builds
  on is an `ε`-correct verifiable secret sharing scheme, whose delivery
  guarantee holds only up to a failure probability `δ`; the specification
  inherits that failure as an outcome of its own. `wccPMF` therefore carries a
  fourth outcome `dead` of mass `δ`, pushed into `val := TVal.dead`. A `dead`
  round enables no `ret`: the return rule's guard is positive
  (`val = ⊤ ∨ val = bit b`), so a failed resolution silently delivers nothing
  and the round's callers wait forever. This is distinct from `⊤`, where
  delivery does happen and the adversary merely picks each process's returned
  bit.

The instance only steps on its own round-`r` API labels, `fail`, and `τ`; the
family combinator (`System.family`) supplies idle self-loops on every other
label.
