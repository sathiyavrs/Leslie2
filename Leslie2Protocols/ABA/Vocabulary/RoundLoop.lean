# The ABA core (the source blueprint's Algorithm 1 = ABDY22's Algorithm 2)

The per-process algorithm of the round loop of ABDY22's Asynchronous Byzantine
Agreement protocol. The pseudocode is the source blueprint's Algorithm 1,
which realises **ABDY22's Algorithm 2** —
the weak-coin framework `AA_ε`: rounds of GBCA followed by a weak-coin flip,
the coin adopted only on a `⊥` decision — with the DECIDED gossip below in
place of the paper's bare grade-2 commit. (The paper's Algorithm 1 is the
*strong*-coin framework over ungraded BCA and is not encoded anywhere in this
development; algorithm numbers below refer to the source blueprint unless the
paper is named.) Per process, on external input `b`:

    r ← 0
    loop:
      (b, g) ← GBCA_r(b)          -- b ∈ {0,1,⊥}, g ∈ {A,B,C}
      c ← WCC_r()
      if b = ⊥ then b ← c
      else if g = A then multicast ⟨DECIDED, b⟩
      r ← r + 1

    upon ⟨DECIDED, b⟩ from f + 1 senders, not having multicast:
      multicast ⟨DECIDED, b⟩
    upon ⟨DECIDED, b⟩ from n − f senders, having multicast ⟨DECIDED, b⟩:
      return b

The file holds the algorithm alone: the handshake phase `Phase`, the estimate
a graded outcome dictates (`GBCAOutput.estimate`), and the per-process control record
`RoundLoopState`. The record carries no sub-protocol state — the
`callG`/`retG`/`callW`/`retW` interactions are pure handshakes over the API
labels, advancing the process's `phase` and recording the returned data, while
the sub-protocol state itself lives in the round specifications and the coin
oracle — and no network state: the DECIDED sets and the corrupted set belong
to the network. The transitions themselves are `RoundLoopStep`
(`ABA/Composition/Components.lean`), the rows of a round-loop record `RoundLoopRecord` over the
extended alphabet, and `ABDY.ABAProgramStep` (`ABA/ImplementationByABDY/System.lean`), the rows of
the protocol program that carries a round loop beside its stage-side record. This file realises the
Core-side assumptions of `DESIGN-CoreSim.md`: the phase machine (invariant conjunct 4), the DECIDED
diffusion state (conjunct 6), and input coherence (conjunct 5 — the honest
`callG` guard ties the emitted bit to the current estimate).

## Model and deviations (continuing the project's D1–D8)

* **D9 (0-based rounds).** `round : ℕ` starts at `0` where Algorithm 1 starts
  at `r = 1`; the `GBCA_r`/`WCC_r` instance indices shift accordingly.
* **D10 (fused DECIDED-send).** Algorithm 1's `elif g = A: send ⟨DECIDED, b⟩`
  is performed inside the round advance `RoundLoopRecord.stepRound`, joined with the
  network's publication of the bit: receiving the round's coin adopts it when
  `estimate = ⊥`, multicasts `⟨DECIDED, b⟩` when the round's grade was `A b`,
  clears `lastGrade` and advances to the next round, all in one Dirac
  transition. The joint step is the `retWPublish` rendezvous, whose round-loop
  half is the advance and whose network half is the sent insert.
* **D11 (Byzantine handshake rows).** Corrupted processes may make their
  sub-protocol handshakes arbitrarily: each of `callG`/`retG`/`callW`/`retW`
  has a Byzantine handshake row, authorised by `k ∈ F` at the network and constrained
  by no phase or estimate. The round loop contributes an idle row to every
  such a row, so the family-side call/return rules for corrupted ids are never
  blocked by it.
* **D12′ (per-process DECIDED sets, equivocation-capable).** The DECIDED
  multicast state is the network's per-process sent
  `decidedSent : Fin n → Finset Bool`, read on the ABA side as `decidedSent`
  (`ABA/Composition/ABAState.lean`) and mirroring graded agreement's D5 sent-set pattern.
  Honest sends insert into the sent (the fused `retWPublish` publication and the
  `f + 1` relay `decidedSend`; in reachable states DECIDED coherence keeps every
  honest sent at card ≤ 1, so the insert is a first write or a no-op re-send
  of the same bit). Byzantine injection (`byzantineDecided`, guarded only by `k ∈ F`) may
  insert either or both bits at any time — a corrupted process may send
  `DECIDED 0` to one receiver and `DECIDED 1` to another (delivery is
  selective). The delivery rendezvous `decidedDeliver` moves one sent bit into the
  receiver's own row `decidedReceived i j` at most once per (receiver, sender,
  bit) triple, with soundness `b ∈ decidedSent j` on the network's half; the
  `retABA` quorum guard counts distinct *senders* per bit (`decidedCount`).
  The per-process sent sets (D12′) let a corrupted process equivocate in the
  DECIDED sets; a single-entry model would bar that — an under-approximation
  inconsistent with graded agreement.
* **D23 (the corrupted process's replaced program).** A corruption replaces the
  program of the process it names. `RoundLoopRecord.corrupted` carries the
  replacement: the process's own half of `fail` writes the flag, every row
  that reads or writes the process's own record is guarded by
  `corrupted = false`, and the replaced program self-loops on every label of
  the alphabet other than `τ` and the labels on which the process would act on
  its own sub-protocol messages. Those messages are the business of the Byzantine
  handshake rows (D11), which carry it with no round-loop row of the named process.

Two further notes: the return rule has **no** honesty check — corrupted
returns must pass the same `n − f` DECIDED count as honest ones, and the
specification's return rule is likewise blind to honesty — and
`lastGrade` always refers to the *current* round's GBCA
return (it is cleared by the round advance).

/-! ### The round-loop record

A process's control record is not by itself what the composition moves: a
round loop also holds the DECIDED payloads delivered to it. The record below
pairs the two, and is one component of the ABA-side state the core simulation
reads (`ABA/Composition/ABAState.lean`). -/
