# Design — the per-instance GBCA refinement `GBCA.implInst ⊑ GBCA.specInst` (`implRefines`)

Companion design document to the Lean proof in `ABA/ABDY/LadderSim.lean` (relation,
invariant, burst lemmas, per-row simulation), against the implementation shape
in `ABA/ABDY/Ladder.lean` (deviation D18: the full five-level message ladder of
ABDY22's Algorithm 6) and the specification shape in `ABA/Spec/GBCA.lean`
(deviation D19: the exclusion set `dead : Finset Bool` in place of a bound
value). The refinement paragraphs of `blueprint/src/content.tex` — the kill
certificate, the `VOTE` wall, and the two-step kill-then-return burst — are a
condensation of this document.

## Systems

```
implInst P r : System (ImplState P.n) (Lab P.n)     -- ABDY22 Algorithm 6, D1/D5/D8/D18
specInst P r : System (SpecState P.n) (Lab P.n)     -- graded-binding spec, D1/D14/D15/D19
target       : ForwardSimulation (implInst P r) (specInst P r) (instRel P r)
```

Both systems are Dirac-transition LTSs. The instance refinement reaches the
ℕ-indexed families through the round instance (`ABA/ABDY/Instances.lean`), whose
family lifting takes its broadcast ingredient from
`GBCASim.instRel_corrupt`.

### The implementation (D18): the five-level ladder

The implementation transcribes ABDY22's Algorithm 6. The message type is

```lean
inductive Msg : Type
  | input (b : Bool)         -- ⟨echo,  b⟩ of Algorithm 6
  | echo  (b : Bool)         -- ⟨echo2, b⟩
  | vote  (v : Option Bool)  -- ⟨echo3, v⟩,  v ∈ {0, 1, ⊥}
  | bind  (v : Option Bool)  -- ⟨echo4, v⟩
  | seal  (v : Option Bool)  -- ⟨echo5, v⟩
```

and `ProcState` carries one write-once slot per level above `INPUT`:
`sentEcho : Option Bool`, `sentVote sentBind sentSeal : Option (Option Bool)`,
next to `input`, `sentInput : Bool → Bool` and `returned`. `ImplState` is the
per-process states, the D5 set-based network (`sent`, `recv`) and the
corrupted set `F`. Derived counts: `recvCount i m` (distinct senders of the
exact message `m` delivered to `i`), `echoCount`/`voteCount`/`bindCount`/
`sealCount i` (distinct senders of *any* payload at that level), and
`bothValid P s i` (an `n − f` `INPUT b` receipt quorum at `i` for **each**
bit — Algorithm 6's `|approvedVals| > 1`).

The rules, all τ except the labelled API rows. Three conditions run across the
table. D8 participation gating (`input ≠ none`) is on every protocol send,
including the seal level, and on all three returns. The ladder is taken in the
wait-until order of Algorithm 6 from the `BIND` level down: each of those levels
requires the sender's own send at the level below (`hlv`), the returns requiring
the sender's own `SEAL`. The vote level requires no own send, the `ECHO` it
reads being multicast by an `upon` handler and not on the main thread. And the
block boundaries are denials: within a ladder block the `⊥` rule denies its
block's case (a) at either bit, and the returns read as Algorithm 6's
`if (a) … elif (b) … else …`, each carrying the denials of the cases above it.

* `call` / `callLoop` — record the input, multicast `INPUT b` / input-enabled
  self-loop;
* `deliver` — adversarial move of a sent message into a `recv` cell;
* `relay` — `f + 1` `INPUT b` receipts, re-multicast `INPUT b` (amplification);
* `echo` — `n − f` `INPUT b` receipts, multicast `ECHO b` (write-once);
* `voteBit` — `n − f` `ECHO b` receipts, multicast `VOTE b` (write-once);
* `voteBot` — `n − f` any-`ECHO` receipts, `bothValid`, and no `n − f` `ECHO b`
  quorum at either bit, multicast `VOTE ⊥`;
* `bindBit` — `n − f` `VOTE b` receipts and own `VOTE` out, multicast `BIND b`
  (write-once);
* `bindBot` — `n − f` any-`VOTE` receipts, own `VOTE` out, `bothValid`, and no
  `n − f` `VOTE b` quorum at either bit, multicast `BIND ⊥`;
* `sealBit` — `n − f` `BIND b` receipts and own `BIND` out, multicast `SEAL b`
  (write-once);
* `sealBot` — `n − f` any-`BIND` receipts, own `BIND` out, `bothValid`, and no
  `n − f` `BIND b` quorum at either bit, multicast `SEAL ⊥`;
* `byz` — a corrupted sender multicasts anything;
* `retA id v` — an `n − f` `SEAL v` receipt quorum, the process called and its
  own `SEAL` out (grade 2 — case (a), which heads the chain and denies nothing);
* `retB id v` — `n − f` any-`SEAL` receipts, at least one `SEAL v` receipt,
  **`f + 1` `BIND v` receipts**, and `bothValid`, the process called, its own
  `SEAL` out and case (a) denied at either bit (`hnotA`) (grade 1 — Algorithm 6's
  line-25 condition: the `t + 1` `echo4` check is what puts an honest `BIND v`
  behind every grade-1 output);
* `retC id` — an `n − f` `SEAL ⊥` receipt quorum and `bothValid`, the process
  called, its own `SEAL` out, case (a) denied at either bit (`hnotA`), and
  case (b) denied in reduced form (`hnotB`: `∀ v, (∃ k, seal (some v) ∈ recv id k)
  → recvCount (.bind (some v)) < f + 1`) — the reduction is sound because case
  (b)'s other two conjuncts, the `n − f` any-`SEAL` quorum and `bothValid`, are
  this row's own `hcnt` and `hval`, an `n − f` `SEAL ⊥` quorum being in
  particular an `n − f` any-`SEAL` quorum (grade 0);
* `fail` — D1 determinised corruption.

The load-bearing depth of the return evidence: **every grade-≥1 output names a
bit with an honest `BIND` behind it** — `retA` via `n − f` `SEAL v` →
honest sealer → `n − f` `BIND v` receipts → honest binder; `retB` via
`f + 1 > |F|` `BIND v` receipts directly — and an honest `BIND v` sits on an
`n − f` `VOTE v` receipt quorum. The `VOTE` level is write-once, so that
quorum is the object the binding argument counts (paper Lemmas 4.8/4.9 through
E.9).

### The specification (D19): the exclusion set

`SpecState` is `call : Fin n → Option Bool`, `ret : Fin n → Bool`,
`dead : Finset Bool`, `grade : Option Bool`, `F : Finset (Fin n)`; initially
`dead = ∅`. Binding is *negative* information: `dead` is the set of bits the
instance can no longer hand out. The rules:

* `call` / `callLoop` — as in every instance spec (D15 file conventions);
* `bindUnset b` (τ) — guards `s.quorum P`,
  `f + 1 ≤ #{id | s.call id = some (!b) ∨ id ∈ s.F}` (the D15 SuppOK count,
  at the *surviving* bit `!b`), and `hd0 : s.dead = ∅`; effect
  `dead := insert b s.dead`;
* `retA id v` — guards `v ∉ s.dead`, `(!v) ∈ s.dead`,
  `s.grade = none ∨ s.grade = some true`, `s.ret id = false`; effect
  `grade := some true`, mark returned;
* `retB id v` — guards `v ∉ s.dead`, `(!v) ∈ s.dead`, the D15 dissent count
  `f + 1 ≤ #{id' | s.call id' = some (!v) ∨ id' ∈ s.F}`, `s.ret id = false`;
  effect: mark returned;
* `retC id` — guards `1 ≤ s.dead.card`, the two D15 counts (one per bit),
  `s.grade = none ∨ s.grade = some false`, `s.ret id = false`; effect
  `grade := some false`, mark returned;
* `fail` — D1 corruption, `dead` untouched.

The `hd0` guard admits `bindUnset` from the empty set only, so an instance kills
at most once and every reachable state has `dead ∈ {∅, {b}}`
(`GBCASafety.dead_card_le_one`). The once-only kill is also what keeps a round
completable: after an `A`-return a second kill would leave no live bit for the
value-bearing returns while the A-latch blocks `retC`, stranding the processes
yet to return.

`dead` is monotone (only `bindUnset` writes it, by `insert`), so the graded
binding property is structural: a killed bit is never handed out (`v ∉ dead`
guards both value-bearing returns), every `A`/`B`-return pins `(!v) ∈ dead`
whence any two value-bearing returns agree on the surviving bit, and a
`C`-return forces `dead ≠ ∅` permanently — from that moment at most one bit is
ever alive, which is the paper's Binding. Provenance (D14/D15) is carried by
`bindUnset`'s SuppOK count for the surviving bit: a bit `v` handed out at
grade ≥ 1 requires `(!v) ∈ dead`, whose `bindUnset (!v)` certified `f + 1`
F-blind callers of `v`; the budget pigeonhole (`|F| ≤ f` forever) recovers a
never-corrupted genuine caller of `v`.

## The relation

```lean
structure InstRel (P : Params) (s : ImplState P.n) (t : SpecState P.n) : Prop where
  inv       : Inv P s
  call_eq   : ∀ id, t.call id = (s.proc id).input
  ret_eq    : ∀ id, t.ret id = (s.proc id).returned
  F_eq      : t.F = s.F
  dead_cert : ∀ b, b ∈ t.dead → DeadCert P s b
  gradeA_ev : t.grade = some true  → ∃ v i, P.n - P.f ≤ s.recvCount i (.seal (some v))
  gradeC_ev : t.grade = some false → ∃ i,   P.n - P.f ≤ s.recvCount i (.seal none)
```

`call_eq`/`ret_eq`/`F_eq` are the exact abstraction rows, identical in shape
to every other instance relation of the development. `gradeA_ev`/`gradeC_ev`
are the A/C-exclusivity certificates, read at the `SEAL` level (the level the
returns read): two opposing `n − f` `SEAL` quorums intersect in an honest
process with two different `SEAL` payloads, contradicting the write-once
`seal_once` — which is what discharges the spec's grade latches.

`dead_cert` is the load-bearing novelty: the spec's `dead` is bookkeeping the
protocol never stores, so the relation carries a receipt-pattern *kill
certificate* for every dead bit. Note the direction — the relation bounds
`dead` from above (`dead ⊆ {b | DeadCert P s b}`) and never from below; which
bits are actually in `dead` is recovered by case analysis at the return rows,
not stored.

## The kill certificates

```lean
/-- Case A: the opposite bit owns the (unique) `n − f` `ECHO` receipt
quorum. -/
def EchoQuorum (P : Params) (s : ImplState P.n) (v : Bool) : Prop :=
  ∃ i, P.n - P.f ≤ s.recvCount i (.echo v)

/-- Case B: an `n − f` wall of processes each of which is corrupted or has
committed its write-once `VOTE` slot to a payload other than `some b`. -/
def VoteWall (P : Params) (s : ImplState P.n) (b : Bool) : Prop :=
  P.n - P.f ≤ (Finset.univ.filter
    (fun j => j ∈ s.F ∨ ∃ w, (s.proc j).sentVote = some w ∧ w ≠ some b)).card

/-- The kill certificate licensing `b ∈ dead` on the specification side. -/
def DeadCert (P : Params) (s : ImplState P.n) (b : Bool) : Prop :=
  EchoQuorum P s (!b) ∨ VoteWall P s b
```

Both disjuncts kill `b` by making an `n − f` `VOTE b` receipt quorum — the
sole gateway to any grade-≥1 evidence for `b` — impossible forever:

* **Case A** (`EchoQuorum P s (!b)`). Any `VOTE b` quorum contains an honest
  `VOTE b` sender (`n − f > f ≥ |F|`), whose `vote_conf` receipt quorum is an
  `n − f` `ECHO b` quorum; two same-level `n − f` quorums for different bits
  share an honest sender (`exists_honest_recv₂`, `(n−f)+(n−f)−n > f`) that
  multicast two `ECHO` payloads, contradicting the write-once `echo_once`.
  This is `echoQuorum_unique`.
* **Case B** (`VoteWall P s b`). Any later `n − f` `VOTE b` quorum `Q` has all
  its non-`F` members committed to `sentVote = some (some b)` (`recv_sub` +
  `vote_once`), so `Q` meets the wall `D` only inside `F`:
  `|Q| + |D| ≤ n + |Q ∩ D| ≤ n + f`, i.e. `2(n − f) ≤ n + f`, i.e. `n ≤ 3f` —
  against `P.hf`. The wall is the state-predicate form of the paper's
  Lemma 4.9 pinning count ("`n − f` receipts pin `≥ n − f − |F|` honest
  committed voters, leaving `≤ f < n − 2f` free honest votes").

The three certificate obligations:

**(i) Monotonicity.** Receipts only grow (`deliver`), `sentVote` is
write-once and never unset (guard `sentVote = none` on `voteBit`/`voteBot`,
no rule clears it), and `F` only grows (`fail`); every other rule touches
neither `recv`, `sentVote` nor `F`. Packaged as

```lean
theorem DeadCert.mono {s s' : ImplState P.n} {b : Bool}
    (hrecv : ∀ i j m, m ∈ s.recv i j → m ∈ s'.recv i j)
    (hvote : ∀ j w, (s.proc j).sentVote = some w → (s'.proc j).sentVote = some w)
    (hF : s.F ⊆ s'.F) : DeadCert P s b → DeadCert P s' b
```

applied per row exactly like `ImplSupp.mono`. This is
what keeps `dead_cert` a stutter-stable field: `dead` never shrinks and the
certificates never expire.

**(ii) Availability at the kill moments.** The simulation fires `bindUnset`
only inside return bursts, and each return's own evidence yields the needed
certificate:

```lean
/-- Any `n − f` `VOTE v` receipt quorum kills the opposite bit … -/
theorem deadCert_of_voteQuorum (hI : Inv P s) {i v}
    (h : P.n - P.f ≤ s.recvCount i (.vote (some v))) : DeadCert P s (!v)

/-- … and certifies that `v` itself is alive. -/
theorem not_deadCert_of_voteQuorum (hI : Inv P s) {i v}
    (h : P.n - P.f ≤ s.recvCount i (.vote (some v))) : ¬ DeadCert P s v
```

`deadCert_of_voteQuorum` lands in `VoteWall (!v)` — the quorum's members are
each in `F` or committed to `some v ≠ some (!v)`, so the quorum itself is the
wall. `not_deadCert_of_voteQuorum` is the two Case A/B refutations above.
Both value-bearing returns route into a `VOTE` quorum by the harvest chain

```lean
theorem voteQuorum_of_bind_receipts (hI : Inv P s) {i v}
    (h : P.f + 1 ≤ s.recvCount i (.bind (some v))) :
    ∃ k, k ∉ s.F ∧ P.n - P.f ≤ s.recvCount k (.vote (some v))

theorem bind_receipts_of_seal_quorum (hI : Inv P s) {i v}
    (h : P.n - P.f ≤ s.recvCount i (.seal (some v))) :
    ∃ k, k ∉ s.F ∧ P.n - P.f ≤ s.recvCount k (.bind (some v))
```

(`retA`: seal quorum → honest sealer → `seal_conf`; then `n − f ≥ f + 1` and
the first chain: bind receipts → honest binder (`f + 1 > |F|`) → `bind_conf`.
`retB`: its `f + 1` `BIND v` receipts enter the first chain directly.) The
`C`-return has no distinguished bit; its evidence yields a certificate for
*some* bit:

```lean
theorem deadCert_of_sealBot_quorum (hI : Inv P s) {i}
    (h : P.n - P.f ≤ s.recvCount i (.seal none)) : ∃ b, DeadCert P s b
```

Proof shape (this is the sketch's Case A/Case B dichotomy, formalised): the
quorum contains an honest `SEAL ⊥` sender `p` (`n − f > f`); `sealBot_conf`
gives `n − f ≤ s.bindCount p`, so `p` holds an honest any-payload `BIND`
sender `k`. Classical case split on `∃ m b', m ∉ s.F ∧ Msg.vote (some b') ∈
s.sent m` (an honest bit-voter exists somewhere):

* **yes** — `vote_conf` at `m` is an `n − f` `ECHO b'` quorum, so
  `EchoQuorum P s b'` and `DeadCert P s (!b')` by Case A;
* **no** — then `k` cannot have sent `BIND (some v')` (its `bind_conf`
  `VOTE v'` quorum would contain an honest bit-voter), so `k` sent `BIND ⊥`
  and `bindBot_conf` gives `n − f ≤ s.voteCount k`: every non-`F` sender in
  that quorum committed a vote (`vote_once`) that is not a bit (no honest
  bit-voter exists), i.e. `sentVote = some none ≠ some (some b)` for **both**
  bits — `VoteWall` holds for both bits, `DeadCert` for either.

**(iii) The `bindUnset` guards are discharged.** `bindUnset b` needs the
quorum guard and `f + 1` F-blind caller support for `!b`. At a value-bearing
return of `v` (killing `b = !v`, support bit `!(!v) = v`), both come from one
`ECHO` certificate:

```lean
theorem bindUnset_guards (hR : InstRel P s t) {v} (hq : EchoQuorum P s v) :
    t.quorum P ∧ P.f + 1 ≤ (Finset.univ.filter
      (fun id => t.call id = some v ∨ id ∈ t.F)).card
```

— refine the `ECHO v` quorum to an `n − f` `INPUT v` receipt quorum
(`inputQuorum_of_echoQuorum`), whose honest senders hold an input
(`input_called`, D8): that is the quorum guard (`quorum_of_msg_quorum`), and
its count feeds `Inv.supp_of_input_receipts` → `InstRel.spec_supp` for the
SuppOK count. The `EchoQuorum v` input is supplied by
`echoQuorum_of_vote_receipts` off the harvested `VOTE v` quorum
(`n − f ≥ f + 1`). At the `C`-return (killing an arbitrary certified `b*`,
support bit `!b*`), both guards come instead from the returner's own
`bothValid`: the per-bit `n − f` `INPUT` receipt quorum gives the quorum guard
through `quorum_of_msg_quorum`/`input_called`, and `suppI_of_valid` gives the
`f + 1` count for **either** bit — so the guard is available no matter which
bit the certificate names.

### Case A / Case B as named invariants

The soundness fact "the surviving bit at any C-return is determined by prefix
receipts" is not a lemma of the simulation file; it is the conjunction of the
certificate properties above, and it is what makes a *plain forward*
simulation sufficient (no prophecy): at every moment the simulation must
commit a kill, the impl state already contains a monotone certificate naming
the killed bit, and no extension ever produces return evidence for a certified
bit (`not_deadCert_of_voteQuorum` against `DeadCert.mono`). The two named
carriers:

* **Case A** — `deadCert_of_voteQuorum` (an honest `VOTE v`, equivalently an
  `ECHO v` quorum, kills `!v` forever): quorum intersection on the write-once
  `ECHO` level.
* **Case B** — the **no**-branch of `deadCert_of_sealBot_quorum` (a
  `C`-return over an all-⊥ honest vote prefix kills both bits): the
  `VoteWall` counting on the write-once `VOTE` level.

## Kill scheduling and burst shapes

The specification kills by an internal τ-transition, so an implementation
return that needs a not-yet-dead bit killed is answered by a two-step weak
burst through `weakLStep_tauThen`. Unlike a bound-value
design there is no "first return" phase distinction: **every** return row does
the same decidable case split on the spec's `dead`, and the burst is enabled
whenever the kill is missing, regardless of how many returns happened before.
Every burst carries `hd0 : t.dead = ∅`, the `bindUnset` guard:

```lean
/-- `bindUnset (!v) ; retA v` from an all-alive state (`dead = ∅`). -/
theorem killThenRetA_burst {r t id v}
    (hq : t.quorum P)
    (hw : P.f + 1 ≤ (Finset.univ.filter
      (fun k => t.call k = some v ∨ k ∈ t.F)).card)
    (hlive : v ∉ t.dead) (hd0 : t.dead = ∅)
    (hg : t.grade = none ∨ t.grade = some true) (hr : t.ret id = false) :
    (specInst P r).weakLStep t (.retG r id (.A v))
      { t with dead := insert (!v) t.dead, grade := some true,
               ret := Function.update t.ret id true }
```

(the `bindUnset (!v)` support guard reads `some (!(!v))`; `Bool.not_not`
rewrites it to `hw`'s `some v`, and `retA`'s `v ∉ insert (!v) t.dead` follows
from `hlive` and `v ≠ !v`). `killThenRetB_burst` is the same with the dissent
count `f + 1 ≤ #{k | t.call k = some (!v) ∨ k ∈ t.F}` in place of the grade
latch, landing in `{ t with dead := insert (!v) t.dead, ret := … }`. The
`C`-side burst kills one arbitrary bit:

```lean
/-- `bindUnset b ; retC` from an all-alive state (`dead = ∅`). -/
theorem killThenRetC_burst {r t id b}
    (hq : t.quorum P)
    (hw : P.f + 1 ≤ (Finset.univ.filter
      (fun k => t.call k = some (!b) ∨ k ∈ t.F)).card)
    (hd0 : t.dead = ∅)
    (hwT : P.f + 1 ≤ #{k | t.call k = some true  ∨ k ∈ t.F})
    (hwF : P.f + 1 ≤ #{k | t.call k = some false ∨ k ∈ t.F})
    (hg : t.grade = none ∨ t.grade = some false) (hr : t.ret id = false) :
    (specInst P r).weakLStep t (.retG r id .C)
      { t with dead := insert b t.dead, grade := some false,
               ret := Function.update t.ret id true }
```

(`retC`'s `1 ≤ dead.card` holds because `insert` is nonempty).

### Where `hd0` comes from at the call sites

The two value-return rows derive it from the branch they are in rather than
carrying it in the relation. At `retA`/`retB` the row already holds
`hlive : v ∉ t.dead` (the certificate refutation) and enters the burst branch
under `hdead : (!v) ∉ t.dead`, and a `Finset Bool` missing both `v` and `!v` is
empty:

```lean
theorem dead_empty_of_both {d : Finset Bool} {v : Bool}
    (h1 : v ∉ d) (h2 : (!v) ∉ d) : d = ∅
```

so the call sites read `killThenRetA_burst hq hw hlive (dead_empty_of_both
hlive hdead) hgr hret`, and likewise for `retB`. The `retC` row splits on
`Finset.eq_empty_or_nonempty t.dead` outright, so its empty branch *is* `hd0`
and its nonempty branch answers with a single `Step.retC`.

### Which bit the `C`-return kills

`retC` fires the burst only from `t.dead = ∅` (otherwise `1 ≤ t.dead.card`
already holds and a single `Step.retC` answers). The killed bit is
`b* := Classical.choose (deadCert_of_sealBot_quorum …)` — the certified bit
its evidence names: the opposite of the unique honestly-voted bit when one
exists (Case A branch), and canonically `false` in the neither-bit-decidable
case (Case B branch, where both bits are certified and the choice is
arbitrary). Soundness never depends on the choice: both spec-side guards of
`bindUnset b*` hold for either bit (they read `bothValid`), and a certified
bit can never carry later return evidence, so no future row is obstructed by
the pick — if some later `retB v` were to need `v` alive, its evidence proves
`¬ DeadCert P s' v`, and `DeadCert.mono` shows `v` was never certified, hence
never picked.

### The matching table

| impl rule | label | spec answer | relation obligations beyond `Inv.step` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `call` | `callG r id b` | `Step.call` (guard via `call_eq`) | `call_eq`/`ret_eq` re-pointwise; `dead_cert` by `DeadCert.mono` (input write only); grade evs untouched |
| `callLoop` | `callG r id b` | `Step.callLoop` | all fields unchanged |
| `deliver` | τ | stutter (`weakLSilent_refl`) | `dead_cert` via `DeadCert.mono` (recv grows); grade evs via `recvCount_le_recvMsg` |
| `relay` | τ | stutter | frame: sender's `sentInput` only |
| `echo` | τ | stutter | frame: sender's `sentEcho` only |
| `voteBit` / `voteBot` | τ | stutter | `sentVote` goes `none → some _`: `DeadCert.mono`'s persistence hypothesis holds vacuously-forward (wall members already committed) |
| `bindBit` / `bindBot` | τ | stutter | frame: sender's `sentBind` only |
| `sealBit` / `sealBot` | τ | stutter | frame: sender's `sentSeal` only (nothing in the relation reads `sentSeal` outside `Inv`) |
| `byz` | τ | stutter | frame: `sent` pool of a corrupted sender only |
| `retA id v` | `retG r id (A v)` | `(!v) ∈ dead`: single `Step.retA`; else: `killThenRetA_burst` | see below |
| `retB id v` | `retG r id (B v)` | `(!v) ∈ dead`: single `Step.retB`; else: `killThenRetB_burst` | see below |
| `retC id` | `retG r id C` | `dead ≠ ∅`: single `Step.retC`; else: `killThenRetC_burst` on `b*` | see below |
| `fail id` | `fail id` | `Step.fail` (lockstep `corrupt`) | `corrupt_F_eq`; `dead` untouched by spec `corrupt`; `dead_cert` via `DeadCert.mono` (`corrupt_recv`/`corrupt_proc`/`corrupt_F_subset`); grade evs via `corrupt_recvCount` |

The three return rows in detail. Common first move: harvest the honest
`VOTE`-level quorum —

* `retA`: `hcnt : n − f ≤ recvCount id (.seal (some v))` →
  `bind_receipts_of_seal_quorum` → `voteQuorum_of_bind_receipts` (via
  `n − f ≥ f + 1`) → `hvq : n − f ≤ recvCount k (.vote (some v))`;
* `retB`: `hbind : f + 1 ≤ recvCount id (.bind (some v))` →
  `voteQuorum_of_bind_receipts` → `hvq`;

then

1. `hlive : v ∉ t.dead` — from `dead_cert` contraposed by
   `not_deadCert_of_voteQuorum hvq`;
2. grade latch (`retA` only) — `grade_ne_false_of_seal_quorum`: the `SEAL v`
   quorum against `gradeC_ev`'s `SEAL ⊥` quorum meets in an honest
   double-sealer, contradicting `seal_once`;
3. dissent count (`retB` only) — `spec_supp (suppI_of_valid hval (!v))`;
4. case `(!v) ∈ t.dead`: single labelled step. Case `(!v) ∉ t.dead`: burst, with
   `bindUnset_guards` fed by `echoQuorum_of_vote_receipts hvq` and `hd0` by
   `dead_empty_of_both hlive hdead`;
5. restore: `dead_cert` — old bits by `DeadCert.mono` (the step only sets
   `returned`), the new bit `!v` by `deadCert_of_voteQuorum hvq`;
   `gradeA_ev := ⟨v, id, hcnt⟩` (`retA`), other grade evidence by
   monotonicity or vacuity.

`retC`: `hwT`/`hwF` from `suppI_of_valid hval`, the C-latch from
`grade_ne_true_of_sealBot_quorum` (`SEAL ⊥` quorum against `gradeA_ev`'s
`SEAL v` quorum, honest double-sealer, `seal_once`), the burst's `b*` and its
certificate from `deadCert_of_sealBot_quorum`, the `bindUnset` quorum guard
from `quorum_of_msg_quorum` on `bothValid`'s `INPUT` quorum; restore
`gradeC_ev := ⟨id, hcnt⟩` and `dead_cert` as above with `DeadCert b*` for the
new member.

Value agreement needs no dedicated lemmas: with `dead` in place of a bound
value, agreement between successive returns is the guard pair
`v ∉ dead ∧ (!v) ∈ dead` itself, discharged per row by
`not_deadCert_of_voteQuorum` (for `∉`) and the case analysis (for `∈`).

## Invariant inventory

### Shared machinery

The kit the proof draws on, most of it common to the instance refinements of
the development; the `SEAL`-level τ-rows (`sealBit`/`sealBot`) are frame cases
identical in shape to `bindBit`/`bindBot` and need nothing beyond it:

* the weak-transition kit of `Framework/FamilySim.lean`:
  `System.weakLStep_of_step` and `weakLStep_tauThen`;
* network plumbing: `recv_sub`, `recvCount_le_recvMsg`, `mem_mcast_sent`,
  `mem_recvMsg_recv`, `exists_sender_notMem`, `exists_honest_recv₂`,
  `corrupt_*` frame lemmas, `corrupt_F_eq`;
* the corruption budget `F_card` and the D15 input machinery: `ImplSupp`,
  `ImplSupp.mono`, `input_orig`, `input_supp`, `input_called`,
  `Inv.supp_of_input_receipts`, `suppI_of_valid`, `InstRel.spec_supp`,
  `quorum_of_msg_quorum`, `inputQuorum_of_echoQuorum`;
* the `ECHO`-level certificate: `EchoQuorum`, `echoQuorum_unique`,
  `echoQuorum_of_vote_receipts`, and `bindUnset_guards` (quorum + SuppOK count
  out of one `EchoQuorum`);
* conformance and write-once clauses `echo_conf`, `echo_once`, `vote_input`,
  `vote_conf`, `bind_once`, `bind_conf` (`bind_once` serves here as a
  conformance fact only — grade exclusivity is read at the `SEAL` level).

### `Inv` clauses at the `VOTE` and `SEAL` levels

```lean
/-- Honest `VOTE` multicasts are recorded in the write-once `sentVote`. -/
vote_once : ∀ j w, j ∉ s.F → Msg.vote w ∈ s.sent j → (s.proc j).sentVote = some w
/-- Honest `BIND ⊥` is backed by `n − f` any-`VOTE` receipts. -/
bindBot_conf : ∀ j, j ∉ s.F → Msg.bind none ∈ s.sent j → P.n - P.f ≤ s.voteCount j
/-- Honest `SEAL` multicasts are recorded in the write-once `sentSeal`. -/
seal_once : ∀ j w, j ∉ s.F → Msg.seal w ∈ s.sent j → (s.proc j).sentSeal = some w
/-- Honest `SEAL b` is backed by an `n − f` `BIND b` receipt quorum. -/
seal_conf : ∀ j b, j ∉ s.F → Msg.seal (some b) ∈ s.sent j →
  P.n - P.f ≤ s.recvCount j (.bind (some b))
/-- Honest `SEAL ⊥` is backed by `n − f` any-`BIND` receipts. -/
sealBot_conf : ∀ j, j ∉ s.F → Msg.seal none ∈ s.sent j → P.n - P.f ≤ s.bindCount j
/-- Honest sealers hold an input (D8, one level up). -/
seal_input : ∀ j w, j ∉ s.F → Msg.seal w ∈ s.sent j → (s.proc j).input ≠ none
```

`vote_once` and `bindBot_conf` are forced by the kill certificates (`VoteWall`
counting and the Case B branch of `deadCert_of_sealBot_quorum`); the seal
clauses mirror the per-level pattern one level up, with
`seal_once`/`seal_conf`/`sealBot_conf` load-bearing (grade exclusivity and the
two harvest chains) and `seal_input` kept for pattern uniformity only.
Preservation is by the same three schemas as every other clause: the
`_once` clauses by the `sentSeal = none`/`sentVote = none` send guards, the
`_conf` clauses by the sending rule's own receipt guard plus count
monotonicity, everything by frame elsewhere. Count monotonicity needs the
any-payload analogues of `recvCount_le_recvMsg`:

```lean
theorem voteCount_le_recvMsg (s : ImplState n) (i j : Fin n) (m : Msg) (i' : Fin n) :
    s.voteCount i' ≤ (s.recvMsg i j m).voteCount i'
-- likewise bindCount_le_recvMsg
```

(same one-line `Finset.card_le_card` proof at both levels).

The counting core shared by `not_deadCert_of_voteQuorum` (Case B refutation)
and worth stating once:

```lean
/-- Two `n − f`-sized subsets of `Fin n` meeting only inside `F` contradict
`|F| ≤ f < n − 2f`. -/
theorem no_disjoint_quorums {P : Params} {Q D F : Finset (Fin P.n)}
    (hQ : P.n - P.f ≤ Q.card) (hD : P.n - P.f ≤ D.card)
    (hQD : Q ∩ D ⊆ F) (hF : F.card ≤ P.f) : False
```

(`|Q| + |D| = |Q ∪ D| + |Q ∩ D| ≤ n + f`, against `2(n − f) > n + f` from
`P.hf` — the same arithmetic as `exists_honest_recv₂`, exposed as a set
statement because `VoteWall` is a set of *processes*, not a receipt row).

## Why this shape: the compression attack dies at `n = 4, f = 1`

A one-level-shallower reading of the grade-1 evidence — `f + 1` `VOTE v`
receipts in place of `f + 1` `BIND v` receipts, with the `SEAL` level elided
and the returns reading `BIND` quorums — admits the following binding
violation, which pins both D18 and the certificate design. Prefix: `p1`, `p2`,
`p3` are called and echo `0`, `1`, `0` respectively; with both bits `Valid`
everywhere, all three vote ⊥, bind ⊥ (and seal ⊥), and `p1` C-returns off the
three ⊥-receipts while `p4` is held unscheduled at the echo stage. Extension
A: `p4` echoes `0` and votes `0` off the `ECHO 0` senders `{p1, p3, p4}`;
`p2` is corrupted and injects `VOTE 0` and `BIND 0`; `p3` collects `f + 1 = 2`
`VOTE 0` receipts from `{p4, p2}` and B-returns `0`. Extension B is the
mirror image (corrupt `p1`, hand out `1`) — one C-return, two extensions,
two different surviving bits: binding fails, and no forward simulation into
any binding-faithful spec exists.

Against the D18 evidence level the attack dies: in extension A, `p3`'s
`retB 0` needs `f + 1 = 2` `BIND 0` receipts, hence an honest `BIND 0` sender
(`2 > |F| = 1`), hence an `n − f = 3`-strong `VOTE 0` receipt quorum at that
sender. But the prefix pinned the write-once votes of `p1`, `p2`, `p3` at ⊥,
and `p2` is the corrupted slot, so the `VOTE 0` senders available in any
extension are at most `{p4} ∪ F = {p4, p2}` — `2 < 3`, no quorum, no honest
`BIND 0`, no `retB 0` (and a fortiori no `retA 0`: an honest `SEAL 0` needs
three `BIND 0` senders). Symmetrically for bit `1` in extension B. In
certificate terms: at `p1`'s C-return the honest `BIND ⊥` senders' vote
quorums pin `{p1, p2, p3}` as committed-⊥-or-`F`, which is `VoteWall` at
`n − f = 3` for **both** bits — exactly the `∃ b, DeadCert` the `retC` burst
consumes, and exactly why no later receipt pattern can contradict the kill.

## Where the shapes surface downstream

The exclusion set and the kill certificate are read directly by the files
above this one. The `Core/Rel.lean` chain and `Core/Sim.lean` phrase the round skeleton
over `dead`: `IsLastBound g r` is `(g r).dead ≠ ∅ ∧ (g (r + 1)).dead = ∅`,
`Closed g r` is `(g r).dead ≠ ∅ ∨ (g r).grade = some false`, and `a_commit`,
`gradeA_needs_bind`, `bind_supp` and the A-lock certificates are keyed on the
guard pair `(!b) ∈ dead ∧ b ∉ dead` — the D19 rendering of `bind = some b`,
with `bind ≠ none` rendered as `dead ≠ ∅`. `GBCASim.instRel_corrupt`
carries the `dead_cert` row through `DeadCert.mono`, whose three hypotheses it
discharges by `corrupt_recv`, `corrupt_proc` and `corrupt_F_subset`.
`ABDY/Protocol.lean`'s rendering carries the same ladder inside one
process: the stage record `GBCA.StageRec` keeps the write-once `sentSeal` slot in
its `proc` record and carries its own `sealCount` over its inbox rows, the
rendezvous rows `gsndSealBit`/`gsndSealBot` are the seal multicasts read off
that record, and the three `retG` rows (and their `byzRetG` twins) read the seal
level off it. No bridge is needed to the global view: the round-`r` `ImplState`
*is* the round instance's own state — the stage records with their inbox rows
beside the round's message fabric, which holds the per-sender pools and the
corrupted set — and `ImplState.sealCount` reads the receiving program's inbox
rows directly. So `GSub.subSim` consumes `implRefines` as it stands: the
projection `sub_projects` (`ABA/ABDY/Instances.lean`) matches every round-instance
transition with the implementation instance's at that same state, one step for
one step, and this file's refinement answers it, its weak answer read back at the
round instance's interface — which is what licenses replacing a round's instance
by the graded agreement specification.

## Risks and open points

1. **`Bool` negation syntax.** Two elaboration traps. (a) `bindUnset b`'s
   support guard mentions `some (!b)`; instantiating `b := !v` produces
   `some (!(!v))`, which is not
   definitionally `some v` — the burst lemmas carry one
   `simpa only [Bool.not_not]` at the `bindUnset` application. (b) `!` binds
   looser than `∈`/`∉`, so `!v ∈ s.dead` silently elaborates as the coerced
   `!(decide (v ∈ s.dead))`; every membership guard on the negated bit must be
   written `(!v) ∈ s.dead` / `(!v) ∉ t.dead`.
2. **`retB`'s `honce` receipt.** The implementation's `retB` keeps the
   algorithm's "at least one `SEAL v` receipt" guard. The simulation never
   reads it (the `f + 1` `BIND v` receipts carry all evidence), so it rides
   along as pure conformance; it must not be dropped from the rule — the rule
   is the algorithm.
3. **Canonical `C`-kill via `Classical.choose`.** The `retC` row consumes
   `∃ b, DeadCert P s b` nonconstructively. If a later development (e.g. a
   quantitative or decidability layer) needs the choice computable, replace it
   with the explicit case split (`if EchoQuorum … true then false else …`);
   nothing in the simulation depends on which certified bit is chosen.
4. **`dead.card ≤ 1` is an invariant, and the relation still does not carry
   it.** It holds at every state of every execution of the specification
   instance (`GBCASafety.dead_card_le_one`), by the `hd0 : dead = ∅` guard on
   the single writer. The relation neither states nor needs it: each burst gets
   its `hd0` from the branch analysis of its own row (`dead_empty_of_both` at
   the value returns, `Finset.eq_empty_or_nonempty` at `retC`), so adding the
   conjunct would create restoration obligations on every row for no benefit.
   Recorded so nobody "strengthens" the relation into extra work.
5. **`VoteWall` reads process-local slots.** Unlike `EchoQuorum` it counts
   `sentVote` slots, not receipts — still monotone in `F` (a corrupted slot
   stays in the wall via the `j ∈ F` disjunct) and in `sentVote` (write-once),
   which is all the simulation needs. Any per-process decomposition must
   therefore be read through the same accessors as the other `proc`-field
   predicates — `ImplState.proc` for the slot and `ImplState.F` for the
   corrupted set, the latter reading the set held by the round's own message
   fabric, which is the state's second component.
6. **Vacuous-fill hazard in `deadCert_of_sealBot_quorum`.** The Case B branch
   needs the global classical split "some honest bit-voter exists"; its
   **no**-branch uses `bindBot_conf` on a *specific* honest `BIND` sender
   harvested from `sealBot_conf`'s any-`BIND` count. That harvest wants
   `exists_sender_notMem` on an any-payload count, i.e. the payload-returning
   variant `ImplState.exists_bind_sender_notMem`:
   `∃ k w, k ∉ F ∧ Msg.bind w ∈ s.recv p k`, same proof as the exact-message
   version.
