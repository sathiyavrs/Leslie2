# Liveness roadmap: ABA fair termination and the `Leslie_LTS_Liveness` machinery

Technical memo (2026-07-22). Context: the ABA safety stack in this repo is complete and
axiom-clean (`ABA/Results.lean`); liveness (termination) is deliberately out of scope so far.
This note records what ABA liveness would require, what already exists in the sibling
repo `Leslie` (branch `Leslie_LTS_Liveness`), and how the pieces fit. All file:line
references into `Leslie` are as of that branch's current HEAD.

## 1. The target property

ABA termination is a **fair** property, and with the coin this development encodes it is
not a probability-1 property. The target is **fair almost-sure termination** — for every *fair*
scheduler, the protocol decides with probability 1 — at `δ_f = 0`, and **fair
`(1 − g(ε, δ_f))`-sure termination** — for every *fair* scheduler, the protocol decides
with probability at least `1 − g(ε, δ_f)` — in general.

The failure mass is in the encoding, not in the statement of the goal. Both coin resolutions of the
development follow `ABA.Parameters.wccPMF` (`ABA/Vocabulary/Parameters.lean`), which puts mass `δ_f`
(the Lean field `Parameters.δ`, `δ_f` in the blueprint) on the outcome `undelivered`: the coin
resolves without delivering. In TS 3 that outcome is absorbing — `WCC.Step.callResolve` fires once
per instance and `WCC.Step.ret` has a positive guard — so the processes awaiting an undelivered
round's return never return, in any extension, under any scheduler. A single such round therefore
strands positive mass, and no fairness assumption recovers it. The failure mass sits at the correct
processes.

The function `g` is the protocol's, and its value there is left open. Each round is a race between
the `δ_f` failure mass and a decision: a resolution matches the round's surviving bit with
probability `ε` and fails to deliver with probability `δ_f`, and how those compound over the round
sequence depends on the fairness constraint chosen and on the round structure the proof exposes.

The specification fixes the target the race is measured against. `ABA.spec` runs that race at one
point, in the mode loop of §5: from `ControlMode.flipEnabled`, and only where both bits carry `f +
1` support, a flip enables the decision with probability `ε` and fails to deliver with probability
`δ_f`, the remaining mass `1 − ε − δ_f` returns to `ControlMode.flipEnabled`, and an enabled
decision is never withdrawn. A flip-only scheduler from such a state therefore reaches the terminal
mode `ControlMode.noRuleEnabled` with probability `δ_f / (ε + δ_f)`, and that is the
specification-level bound a transfer would carry:

```
g(ε, δ_f) ≤ δ_f / (ε + δ_f),    g(ε, 0) = 0
```

so the `δ_f = 0` instance is exact fair AST. The safety chain already proved is
indifferent to `δ_f` either way.

Both quantifiers of the `δ_f = 0` instance are irreducible (validated against
`Papers/consensus-src`, which proves fair AST for Ben-Or and graded consensus via ranking
supermartingales in Caesar):

- fairness is a qualitative, per-run constraint on the *scheduler* (unfair schedulers
  genuinely prevent termination);
- almost-sureness is a measure-1 quantifier over the *coins* (the all-bad-coins run is
  fair, consistent, and non-terminating — it merely has measure zero). Hence no purely
  qualitative fairness assumption yields per-run termination for ABA.

**What binding contributes.** Every fair-termination argument for this protocol family turns on a
precondition the coin cannot see: the round's value is fixed before the coin resolves, so a
resolution matching it decides. That precondition is structural here rather than an assumption a
liveness proof would have to carry. At the specification, GBCA's exclusion set `excluded` only grows
— its single writer inserts and corruption does not touch it — and both value-bearing returns demand
`v ∉ excluded ∧ !v ∈ excluded`, so any two graded returns of one round hand out the same bit and a
grade-0 return determines a bit that no extension of the run hands out at grade ≥ 1: `retG_value_agree`,
`specInst_binding`, `retGrade0_excluded_nonempty` (`ABA/GBCA/SpecificationSafety.lean`), each from
monotonicity alone, no invariant. The precondition is on the trace, not only on the state: every
return of a round announces the round's bound bit on its label (D29), so `specInst_binding` reads it
off the labels of a single trace, and the coin's race is against a bit the trace has already named.
At the implementation the encoding is ABDY22's Algorithm 6 in full (D18), whose Binding the paper
proves. The precondition is therefore available in both systems of the refinement, and a liveness
effort inherits it rather than re-deriving it; what it must supply is the probabilistic part, the
race between the coin's `ε` mass and the `δ_f` failure mass.

In this repo's terms: the statement lives naturally at the trace-distribution level —
"every fair-achievable trace distribution of `ABA.spec` gives mass at least
`1 − g(ε, δ_f)` to traces where every correct process fires `retABA`" — and such mass
bounds DO transfer along fair-trace-distribution inclusions, being universally quantified
over the trace distributions of the including system.

## 2. What each repository supplies

**Leslie2 (this repo)** — probabilistic simulation, *complete*:
- Weak probabilistic forward simulation with proven soundness AND transitivity
  (`Results.lean`; the ω-composition is `weakTau_flatten`).
- The full ABA safety chain, stated in the protocol's own coordinates: the protocol carried into the
  composition of components, the substitution of each round's graded-agreement instance by its
  specification (`GBCA impl ⊑ spec` under one family congruence), and the core simulation of the
  hybrid against the ABA specification.
- `Leslie2Extra/Fairness`: fairness-marked PLTS + ranked **strong** probabilistic
  simulation, sound for surely-fair achievable trace distributions
  (`fairAchievableTraceDists_subset`, needs `ImageFinite` for a König lift). Proven.
- No liveness proof rules, no martingale/variant machinery, no trajectory-measure connection from
  the Fairness line (a separate Ionescu–Tulcea line exists in `Leslie2Extra/Measure`).

**Leslie, branch `Leslie_LTS_Liveness`** — possibilistic liveness, *complete*; probabilistic
port, *started*:
- `Leslie_LTS/Framework/{Liveness,Divergence,LTL,Rules,Trace,Simulation}.lean`: TLA-style
  weak/strong fairness per label, leads-to + WF1 + lattice rules, shallow LTL (incl. past
  operators, `[ltl| …]` DSL), fair-divergence notions — all **sorry-free**.
- The ranked witness `ForwardSim.WeakDivPreserving` (`Simulation.lean:1339`): decorates the
  weak/stuttering `ForwardSim`; well-founded rank on concrete states; obligations keyed on
  fair-vs-unfair concrete steps and on the abstract answer being empty / non-`AllFair`;
  fair-deadlock clause. Transfer theorems **proven**: `preserves_fair_weak_divergence`
  (:1506), `transfers_satisfaction` (:2110), `transfers_leads_to` (:2246). This formalizes
  the possibilistic fair version of Gaspard's CONCUR 2026 material (§6.2 + §6.4 per
  `plans/fair-weak-div-sim.md`); §6.3 (the probabilistic version) is not formalized there.
- `Leslie_LTS/Framework/Probabilistic.lean`: a PLTS model with **the identical step shape to
  Leslie2's** (`step : State → Label → PMF State → Prop`) plus proven LTS↔PLTS adapters (`fromLTS`
  Dirac embedding, `toLTS` support unfolding, roundtrip lemma). The files atop it
  (`WeakProbabilistic.lean`, `ProbSimulation.lean` — weak τ-transitions, coupling-based
  `WeakProbSim`) are sorried (9 + 4): they are, structurally, an unfinished re-derivation of exactly
  what Leslie2 has already proven end-to-end.
- `Leslie/Prob/`: the certificate line on a different (functional, guarded-action) model
  `ProbActionSpec` — `FairASTCertificate` (Majumdar–Sathiyanarayana POPL'25 Rule 3.2 +
  fair extension) with `sound` **proven**, conditional on caller-supplied trajectory
  witnesses (`TrajectoryFairProgress` etc.); Ionescu–Tulcea trace measures; probabilistic
  Abadi–Lamport refinement. Two real sorries remain (`RandomisedAdversary.lean`). No
  translation from `ProbActionSpec` to the relational PLTS model.

The two repos are complementary halves of one program: Leslie has liveness without
(finished) probabilistic simulation; Leslie2 has probabilistic simulation without liveness.

## 3. Is the ranked fair-divergence witness "exactly what ABA needs"?

**It is the right design on the wrong model — with one hard-won warning attached.**

*Right design*: it handles precisely what `Leslie2Extra/Fairness` does not — stuttering.
The ABA chain's simulations are weak (the core simulation's lazy abstract state stutters on almost
every row), so any fairness-preservation for ABA must discipline stutters exactly the way
`WeakDivPreserving` does (rank must decrease when the abstract answers a fair concrete
step with silence).

*Wrong model*: it is qualitative; ABA's property is a mass bound over fair schedulers
(§1). A port into the
probabilistic setting is needed — i.e., the not-yet-formalized §6.3, for which Leslie2's
proven weak-simulation stack is the natural substrate.

*The warning* (empirical, from the possibilistic-liveness proofs themselves): **both flagship
protocol proofs on that branch (BRB, BCA) abandoned the witness-transfer route** — a "corrupt-sender
fairness mismatch": an action that is unconditionally fair at the specification corresponds, under a
corrupt sender, to only-unfair concrete steps, making the antecedent-transfer obligation
(`h_ante_transfer`) and the fair-deadlock clause unprovable; specification fair weak divergence
*genuinely fails*. Both protocols instead prove liveness **directly** on the concrete system via
`assumes_fair_wf` + WF1/leads-to chains (sorry-free), keeping simulation for safety only. ABA has
the same corruption structure (Byzantine processes, adversarial delivery), so the same mismatch
should be expected at the `protocol ↔ ABA.spec` boundary.

## 4. Recommended shape of an ABA liveness effort

Ordered by expected value-for-effort:

1. **Spec-level liveness, simulation for safety only** (mirrors the successful BRB/BCA
   pivot AND the consensus-src architecture). Prove the §1 target for `ABA.spec` directly:
   port the fairness/WF1/leads-to toolkit to PLTS traces, state the decide-mass property
   over fair schedulers, and discharge it with a supermartingale/variant certificate —
   either by bridging `Leslie/Prob`'s proven-conditional `FairASTCertificate.sound` to the
   PLTS model, or by re-deriving the rule on Leslie2's model (the `Leslie2Extra/Measure`
   Ionescu–Tulcea line supplies the trajectory measure). consensus-src's GBCA/Ben-Or
   certificates show what the variant functions look like. Deliverable: "under fair
   scheduling, `ABA.spec` decides with probability at least `1 − g(ε, δ_f)`", the
   `δ_f = 0` case reading as a.s. decision; combined with the existing safety refinement
   this is already a strong end-point.
2. **The §6.3 port** (ambitious add-on): `FairWeakProbabilisticSimulation` — merge
   `WeakDivPreserving`'s stutter-ranking with `Leslie2Extra/Fairness`'s probabilistic descent/König
   machinery over Leslie2's weak simulation. Sound transfer of fair trace-distribution inclusion
   would push the spec-level mass bound down the chain to `ABDY.protocol`, which is where a
   fair-scheduling statement about this protocol belongs. All three steps are inclusions in the same
   direction, `protocol ⊑ composed ⊑ hybrid ⊑ ABA.spec`, so a mass bound established at `ABA.spec`
   has to be transported down all three, the composition inclusion (`ABDY.protocolSimulation`,
   `ABA/ImplementationByABDY/Simulation.lean`) included. That inclusion imposes no constraint on the
   amplification axis. Under D22 a process retains the round record of every round it has touched
   and answers that round's messages under an instance-local guard, whichever round its loop is in,
   which is the behaviour ABDY22's Lemmas 4.6 and E.5 are stated under; and
   `ABAProgramStep.terminate` fires only once the process's own return has fired and `2f + 1`
   DECIDED receipts are on record, so the concrete stopping point is a terminate in the paper's
   sense — the endpoint a fairness marking would stop at. Nothing in the development says when that
   step fires, or that it ever does: the marking itself and every statement about it are what a
   campaign has to supply. Budget the corrupt-fairness mismatch as the primary risk: the fairness
   markings in both systems must be chosen so that specification actions are fair only under
   enablement at a correct process (state-dependent `fair_labels` — the witness already supports
   state-dependence; the BRB/BCA failure was a modeling choice as much as a theorem gap). The two
   failure outcomes agree by construction (§5), so the markings have nothing to reconcile on that
   axis.
3. **Model unification** (background hygiene): Leslie_LTS's PLTS + adapters are step-shape-identical
   to Leslie2's `System`; its sorried `WeakProbabilistic`/ `ProbSimulation` files are subsumed by
   Leslie2's proven ones. Converging on one probabilistic model would let the LTS liveness toolkit
   and Leslie2's simulation stack meet without duplication.

One cost note, on any of the three. The achievability item of `ABA/README.md` — an explicit
scheduler taking `protocol fourProcesses` to a two-return trace of positive mass — is expensive
under the wait-until order and the case denials: every round send waits on the sender's own send at
the level below, and every return but `retGrade2` discharges the denials of the cases above it, so a
witness has to schedule the full five-level exchange at each participating process and then exhibit
those denials at each returner.

## 5. Design note: the two failure outcomes under fairness

The `δ_f` mass is encoded twice, and the two encodings agree. Neither is visible to
safety; both matter to any fair-inclusion proof.

In TS 3 the failure outcome is absorbing. `WCC.Step.callResolve` requires `hv : s.val = .bot`,
so an instance resolves once — every later call takes `WCC.Step.callRecord` (D31) — and
`WCC.Step.ret`'s guard `s.val = .top ∨ s.val = .bit b` is positive, so a resolution at
`CoinValue.undelivered` enables no return in any extension.

In TS 1 the same mass puts the control mode at `ControlMode.noRuleEnabled`, which is globally
absorbing
(D17). `PLTS.ABA.SpecStep.coinFlip` is one-shot: its guard `hm : s.mode = .idle` admits it
only at `ControlMode.flipEnabled`, and its `undelivered` outcome — mass `δ_f` under
`PLTS.ABA.flipPMF` — leaves
the state at `ControlMode.noRuleEnabled`. The only other `τ`-rule is `PLTS.ABA.SpecStep.decide`,
whose
guard `hm : s.mode ≠ .terminal` rules out exactly that mode. A terminal-mode specification therefore
decides nothing and returns nothing, in any extension, under any scheduler, which is what
the absorbed TS 3 instance does one level down. The two encodings agree on what a fair
scheduler can be obliged to do, and no marking has anything to reconcile between them.

The enabled decision is the symmetric half. `flipPMF` puts mass `ε` on `toDecisionEnabled`, whose
post-state is `ControlMode.decisionEnabled`; there the flip demands `ControlMode.flipEnabled`, so
`SpecStep.decide` is the only `τ`-rule that can be enabled at all. It is enabled exactly when some
bit carries `f + 1` support, and a state that has passed the flip's own guard leaves some bit
supported ever after. The forcing runs on the *sum* of the two support counts. Neither count is
monotone by itself: `SpecStep.callSet`'s overwrite takes its writer out of one of the two supporter
sets. The sum is. An overwrite moves a supporter from one set to the other and leaves the sum where
it was; a write into an empty entry raises it by one; a `fail` puts its identifier into both sets
through the `id ∈ s.F` disjunct and raises it by one or two; `SpecStep.callByzantine` writes only at
identifiers that disjunct already counts at both bits, so it moves neither count. The flip's `hmix`
guard asks `f + 1` at each bit, so the sum stands at `2f + 2` or above at every enabling of the
decision, hence at every later state one of the two counts is `f + 1` or above and `SpecStep.decide`
is enabled. An enabled decision is never withdrawn: at `ControlMode.decisionEnabled` the one
internal move a scheduler has is the decision. The remaining mass `1 − ε − δ_f` returns the state to
`ControlMode.flipEnabled`, where the flip is enabled again, so a flip-only scheduler runs the
`ε`-versus-`δ_f` race to absorption and enables the decision with probability `ε / (ε + δ_f)`. That
is the bound §1 records.

**The guard and the liveness half of Validity.** `hmix` also settles the unanimous case
structurally, at the specification and with no proof obligation. A supported bit has a
never-corrupted recorded inputter (`InputSupport.correct_supporter`,
`Specifications/ABASafety.lean`), so under unanimity among the correct processes on `v` the bit `!v`
is supported by corrupted identifiers alone, at most `f` of them, and `hmix` fails at every state
such a run reaches. The flip is then unreachable, and with it every probabilistic branch of the
system: the unanimous path is Dirac, and `SpecStep.decide` can write only `v`. That is the liveness
half of Validity — "if all correct processes input `v` then all correct processes return `v`" — held
by the shape of the guard rather than by an argument.

**Transfer caveat: the δ-exposure of the unanimous path.** The spec-level guarantee transfers to the
protocol only at `δ_f = 0`, or under a the protocol's reordering. With `δ_f > 0` the implementation
consults the coin under unanimity: the round loop's phase machine calls `WCC_r` after every
graded-agreement return, the coin adoption being a later line of ABDY22's Algorithm 2 than the call,
so a unanimous round still runs a resolution that carries mass `δ_f` on the outcome that delivers to
nothing and strands the processes awaiting it. The specification's unanimous path has no such
branch, so the two agree on the unanimous case only when `δ_f = 0` or when the protocol is reordered
to skip the coin call on a grade the round has already settled. This is the campaign's transfer
caveat and is recorded here rather than repaired.

**The transfer hook.** The specification names no coin bit. `flipPMF` is `Parameters.wccPMF` pushed
forward along a map that forgets which bit was delivered: one bit to `toDecisionEnabled`, the other
bit and the adversarial outcome to `toFlipEnabled`, the failure outcome to `undelivered`. The three
masses are all the rules read. Reading `toDecisionEnabled` as "the coin agreed with the round's
surviving bit" is accordingly not a component of TS 1 — it is what a liveness refinement would
supply, as an outcome coupling between the coin's resolving call and `flipPMF`: the agree-outcome,
of mass `ε`, coupled to `toDecisionEnabled`; the disagree- and adversarial outcomes to
`toFlipEnabled`; the failure outcome, of mass `δ_f`, to `undelivered`. Safety needs none of it,
which is why the specification carries the mode and not the bit.

## 6. Design note: the GBCA exclusion under fairness

The GBCA specification's `bindUnset` carries the guard `excluded = ∅`
(`ABA/GBCA/Specification.lean`), so one exclusion happens per instance. Safety is
indifferent to the guard — every statement of `GBCA/SpecificationSafety.lean` rests on
monotonicity of `excluded` and would hold without it — but a fair reading of the
specification is not.

Suppose the guard were the per-bit one, `b ∉ excluded`, so that a round could exclude both bits in
turn. Take a mixed round: a quorum, `f + 1` F-blind support at each bit, and a grade-2 return of `v`
already fired. `bindUnset v` is then enabled — its guards would be the quorum, `f + 1` support for
the spared bit `!v`, and `v` not yet excluded, none of which the return disturbs — so under a
blanket-fair marking of the internal transitions every fair scheduler must eventually fire it. After
that exclusion no bit is alive: `retGrade2` and `retGrade1` are disabled at both bits, and
`retGrade0` is disabled by the grade-2 guard (`grade = some true`). The processes that had not yet
returned never return, in any extension, under any scheduler. Spec-level Termination — "if `n − f`
correct processes take part then all correct processes eventually return" — would then be false of
the specification itself, and no marking at the implementation could repair it.

The `excluded = ∅` guard removes those states rather than the obligation. Every reachable state
has `excluded ∈ {∅, {b}}` (`GBCASafety.excluded_card_le_one`), the surviving bit stays alive, and
the grade-2 guard still admits grade-2 and grade-1 returns. The resolution is structural, so no
marking has anything to decide here. The same holds of TS 1's flip (§5), where the one-shot guard
and the absorbing `ControlMode.noRuleEnabled` settle the question in the step relation rather than
in a marking.

**Termination proof sketch for the specification as encoded.** Assume the `n − f` correct
processes have called, so the quorum guard holds and holds forever (the count is monotone
in `call` and `F`). The quorum's `n − f ≥ 2f + 1` callers-or-corrupted fall on two bits, so
some bit `v` carries `f + 1` of them by pigeonhole — the `InputSupport(v)` count, itself monotone.
All three guards of `bindUnset (!v)` therefore hold, and they persist until the rule is
taken, so weak fairness fires it; `excluded = {!v}` from then on, and `v` is alive at every
later state.

Split on whether the dissent count at `!v` ever reaches `f + 1`. If it never does, `retGrade1`
and `retGrade0` stay disabled forever — each asks `f + 1` at the dissenting bit, `retGrade0` at both
bits — and no grade-0 lock can arise, so `retGrade2 v` is enabled at every un-returned process for
the rest of the run and the round decides. This is the near-unanimous case: under unanimous
correct input the count is capped by the corruption budget outright
(`GBCASafety.support_le_of_unanimous`). If the count does reach `f + 1`, then from that point
`retGrade1 v` is enabled at every un-returned process, whatever the grade lock, since `retGrade1`
reads no grade. Either way each un-returned process has a return enabled from some point on
and permanently, so a fair scheduler answers it. Nothing in the sketch mentions the coin: it
is a statement about one GBCA instance, and it is what item 1 of §4 would have to supply for
the sub-protocol position.
