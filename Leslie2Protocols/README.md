# Leslie2Protocols — the protocol case studies

The second of the repository's three Lake libraries. It imports the core `Leslie2` and
nothing in the core imports it. Both are default `lake build` targets, so the API
documentation covers them and the blueprint's links resolve.

## `ABA/`

The asynchronous binary agreement development: machine-checked safety for randomized ABA,
from the protocol as it runs down to a small specification, by probabilistic forward
simulation, with two verified implementations of its graded-agreement sub-protocol —
one direct, one built over gather and reliable broadcast. Each is carried from the
protocol as it runs, through one flat reading written parametrically in the
implementation and instantiated twice. 43 files, and its own file guide in
[`ABA/README.md`](ABA/README.md).

## `Framework/`

The protocol-independent combinators the case study composes with. One of them —
restriction along the left summand of an extended alphabet — is a fourth precongruence,
beside the three in the core.

| file | lines | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| [`TraceSupport.lean`](Framework/TraceSupport.lean) | 594 | From trace-distribution support to genuine executions: the safety transfer, the invariant inductions, and the label-side transport of a run. |
| [`IdleFamily.lean`](Framework/IdleFamily.lean) | 221 | Idle padding, partial label pullbacks, and ℕ-indexed instance families with a broadcast disjunct. |
| [`FamilySim.lean`](Framework/FamilySim.lean) | 385 | Forward simulation is a congruence for `System.family`: per-instance refinement lifts to the family. |
| [`SyncProduct.lean`](Framework/SyncProduct.lean) | 177 | Full-synchronisation product of a finite family — a visible label moves every component, τ moves one. |
| [`Relabel.lean`](Framework/Relabel.lean) | 471 | Extended alphabets and restriction along the left summand, with the precongruence for it. |
| [`WeakBurst.lean`](Framework/WeakBurst.lean) | 188 | Weak runs from step chains: prepending a silent step, and the k-fold burst — a chain of silent steps closed by one external step. |
| [`MapIdleSim.lean`](Framework/MapIdleSim.lean) | 191 | Forward simulation is a congruence for reading both systems over a finer alphabet along a partial label map. |

## Notes

| file | what it is for |
|---|---|
| [`DESIGN-Composition.md`](DESIGN-Composition.md) | Why the chain is cut where it is: what the composition buys, where each network is external, and what the DECIDED model already weakens. |
| [`DESIGN-CoreSim.md`](DESIGN-CoreSim.md) | The narrative account of the core simulation `hybrid ⊑ ABA.spec` — the abstract twin, the invariant, and the certificates decided values ride on. |
| [`DESIGN-GBCASim.md`](DESIGN-GBCASim.md) | The narrative account of the per-instance GBCA refinement — kill-on-demand, the receipt-pattern certificates, and the burst structure. |
| [`DESIGN-GatherTower.md`](DESIGN-GatherTower.md) | The narrative account of the gather-based GBCA stack — why the gather specification carries a core family, the BIND-by-broadcast pinning, the member-form counting, the chain-data discipline of its simulations, and the flat reading beneath the composed one. |
| [`NOTES-Fidelity.md`](NOTES-Fidelity.md) | How the encoding stands against its sources — the Leslie blueprint, ABDY22 and AFW25: where it follows one against another, and what it deliberately does not reproduce. |
| [`NOTES-Liveness-Roadmap.md`](NOTES-Liveness-Roadmap.md) | Termination is out of scope; this is what proving it would take. |

The prose account of the case study is the ABA chapter of the repository's blueprint
(`../blueprint/src/`), which carries it in two editions over one set of statements.
